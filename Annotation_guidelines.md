## Rules for Annotation of Text Worlds: Experiment II. “The Gift of the Magi” by O. Henry

We annotate lexical markers of three world-building elements: time, place, character.

We annotate lexical and grammatical markers of shifts in two world-building elements: time, place.

Lexical markers are words and word groups with predominant lexical meaning without function words attached to them (outside a word group), but including function words used inside a group: to the <place>seaside</place>. 

Grammatical markers are function words, morphemes and lexicalized grammatical categories, e.g. markers of verb forms placed after verbs: <time>left *VBD*</time>.

### Time: t (marker of time), ts (marker of time shift)

We annotate all lexical markers of time: <t>Presently,</t>.

We annotate a shift in time if it is expressed with a lexical marker or a grammatical tense of a verb: <ts>Two years passed,</ts>, He <ts>left *VBD*</ts>.

NOTE. If a shift is expressed with a grammatical tense of a verb, the tag includes the verb and its annotated form: <ts>left *VBD*</ts>. Grammatical forms of verbs are put between *...* and denote:

* VB	Verb, base form,
* VBD	Verb, past tense,
* VBG	Verb, gerund or present participle,
* VBN	Verb, past participle,
* VBP	Verb, non-3rd person singular present,
* VBZ	Verb, 3rd person singular present.

### Place: p+Number (marker of place), ps (marker of place shift)

We annotate lexical markers of place with the number identifying this place in order of appearance of places in the text: <p1>Mars</p1>, <p2>kitchen</p2>, <p1>there</p1>.

We annotate place shifts: …<ps>to</ps> the <p2>kitchen</p2>, ...ran <ps>there</ps>.

We annotate single mentions of a place outside the place, where the text world is built, with “x” and do not assign a number to this place, even though it can be mentioned in the text again later: They dreamed of traveling to the <px>seaside</px>.

NOTE. We annotate:

* open places like a landscape and all of its subplaces, if their borders are not outlined directly to hold all the characters of a text world, as a single place: <p1>Mars</p1>, its <p1>valleys</p1> and <p1>canyons</p1>;
* outer interiors with outlined or presumed borders: <p3>a garden</p3>, <p4>a field</p4>, <p5>a valley</p5>, <p6>a canyon</p6>;
* inner interiors that hold all the characters of a text world: a <p7>room</p7>;
* two or more places simultaneously connected with a tele-connection (radio, TV, Internet, telepathy, fantasy, etc.) and holding all the characters of a text world: ...he spoke to a voice <p8>on the other end of the line</p8>.

## Character: c+Number (marker of character), cg (marker of a group of characters)

We annotate lexical markers of characters with the number, identifying characters in order of their appearance in the text: <c1>Douglas</c1>, <c2>Sheril</c2>, <c1>he</c1>, <c1>his</c1>.

We annotate lexical markers of groups of characters with no numbers if participants of a group are unknown: He watched <cg>passers-by</cg>; otherwise, we put tags within a group tag: He watched the <cg><c6><c7>passers-by</c6></c7></cg>.

We annotate single mentions of a character that does not participate in the story with “x” and do not assign a number to this character, even though he/she can be mentioned in the text again later: He saw some <px>people</px> outside.

NOTE. We annotate:

cases of creative (original) personification as a new character, including places that start acting as living beings: The <c3>car</c3> winked and hid behind the corner; His <c4>company’s</c4> values were…; <c5>Earth</c5> is kind to people.
