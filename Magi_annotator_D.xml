<title>THE GIFT OF THE MAGI</title>
<author>by O. Henry</author>

One dollar and eighty-seven cents . That was *VBD* all . And sixty cents of it was *VBD* in pennies . Pennies saved *VBD* one and two at a time by bulldozing *VBG* the <cx>grocer</cx> and the <cx>vegetable man</cx> and the <cx>butcher</cx> <t>until</t> <c1>one ’ s</c1> cheeks burned *VBN* with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing *VBG* implied *VBN* . <t>Three times</t> <c1>Della</c1> counted *VBD* it . One dollar and eighty-seven cents . And the <ts>next day</ts> <ts>would be *VB*</ts> <t>Christmas</t> . 

There was *VBD* clearly nothing to do *VB* but flop *VB* down on the shabby little couch and howl . So <c1>Della</c1> did *VBD* it . Which instigates *VBZ* the moral reflection that life <ts>is *VBZ* made *VBN* up</ts> of sobs , sniffles , and smiles , with sniffles predominating *VBG* . 

<t>While</t> the <ch1>mistress</ch1> of the <p1>home</p1> is *VBZ* gradually subsiding *VBG* from the first stage to the second , take *VB* a look at the <p1>home</p1> . A furnished <p1>flat</p1> at $ 8 per week . It <ts>did *VBD*</ts> not exactly beggar description , but it certainly had *VBD* that word on the lookout for the <cg>mendicancy squad</cg> . 

<ps>In</ps> the <p2>vestibule below</p2> was *VBD* a letter-box into which no letter <ts>would go *VB*</ts> , and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax *VB* a ring . Also appertaining *VBG* thereunto <ts>was *VBD*</ts> a card bearing *VBG* the name “ <c2>Mr . James Dillingham Young </c2>. ” *VBD* 

The “ Dillingham ” <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* flung *VBN*</ts> to the breeze <t>during a former period of prosperity</t> <t>when</t> its <c2>possessor</c2> was *VBD* being *VBG* paid *VBN* $ 30 per week . <ts>Now</ts> , <ts>when</ts> the income <ts>was *VBD* shrunk *VBN*</ts> to $ 20 , though , <cg><c1><c2>they</c2></c1></cg> were *VBD* thinking *VBG* seriously of contracting *VBG* to a modest and unassuming D. But <ts>whenever</ts> <c2>Mr. James Dillingham Young</c2> came *VBD* <p1>home</p1> and reached *VBD* <c2>his</c2> <p1>flat above</p1> he was *VBD* called *VBN* <c2>“ Jim ”</c2> and greatly hugged *VBN* by <c1>Mrs. James Dillingham Young</c1> , <t>already</t> introduced *VBN* to <c3>you</c3> as <c1>Della</c1> . Which <ts>is *VBZ*</ts> all very good . 

<c1>Della</c1> <ts>finished *VBD*</ts> <c1>her</c1> cry and attended *VBD* to <c1>her</c1> cheeks with the powder rag . She stood *VBD* <ps>by the window</ps> and looked *VBD* out dully at a gray cat walking *VBG* a gray fence in a gray <px>backyard</px> . <ts>Tomorrow</ts> <ts>would be *VB*</ts> <t>Christmas Day</t> , and <c1>she</c1> <ts>had *VBD*</ts> only $ 1.87 with which to buy *VB* <c2>Jim</c2> a present . <c1>She</c1> <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* saving *VBG*</ts> every penny <c1>she</c1> could <t>for months</t> , with this result . Twenty dollars a <t>week</t> <ts>doesn ’ t go *VBP* far </ts>. Expenses <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN*</ts> greater than <c1>she</c1> had *VBD* calculated *VBN* . They <ts>always</ts> are *VBP* . Only $ 1.87 to buy *VB* a present for <c2>Jim</c2> . <c1>Her</c1> <c2>Jim</c2> . <ts>Many a happy hour</ts> <c1>she</c1> <ts>had *VBD* spent *VBN*</ts> planning *VBG* for something nice for <c2>him</c2> . Something *VBG* fine and rare and sterling—something *VBG* just a little bit near to being *VBG* worthy of the honor of being *VBG* owned *VBN* by <c2>Jim</c2> . 

There <ts>was *VBD*</ts> a pier glass <ps>between</ps> the windows of the <p4>room</p4> . Perhaps <c3>you</c3> <ts>have *VBP* seen *VBN*</ts> a pier glass <ps>in</ps> an $ 8 <p1>flat</p1> . A very thin and very agile <cx>person</cx> <ts>may</ts> , by observing *VBG* <cx>his</cx> reflection <ps>in</ps> a <px>rapid sequence of longitudinal strips</px> , <ts>obtain *VB*</ts> a fairly accurate conception of <cx>his</cx> looks . <c1>Della</c1> , being *VBG* slender , <ts>had *VBD* mastered *VBN*</ts> the art . 

Suddenly <c1>she</c1> <ts>whirled *VBD*</ts> <p5>from the window</p5> and stood *VBD* <ps>before</ps> the <p6>glass</p6> . <c1>Her</c1> eyes were *VBD* shining *VBG* brilliantly , but <c1>her</c1> face had *VBD* lost *VBN* its color <ts>within twenty seconds</ts> . Rapidly <c1>she</c1> pulled *VBD* down <c1>her</c1> hair and let *VB* it fall *VB* to its full length . 

Now , there were *VBD* two possessions of the <cg><c1><c2>James Dillingham Youngs</c2></c1></cg> in which <cg><c1><c2>they</c2></c1></cg> both took *VBD* a mighty pride . One was *VBD* <c2>Jim ’ s</c2> *VBD* gold watch that <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN*</ts> <c2>his</c2> <cx>father ’ s</cx> and <c2>his</c2> <cx>grandfather ’ s</cx> . The other <ts>was</ts> *VBD* <c1>Della ’ s</c1> *VBD* hair . <ts>Had *VBD*</ts> the <c4>queen of Sheba</c4> <ts>lived *VBD*</ts> <ps>in</ps> the <px>flat</px> across the <px>airshaft</px> , <c1>Della</c1> <ts>would have *VB* let *VB*</ts> <c1>her</c1> hair *VB* hang out the window <t>some day</t> to dry *VB* just to depreciate *VB* <c4>Her Majesty ’ s</c4> jewels and gifts . <ts>Had</ts> <c5>King Solomon</c5> <ts>been *VBN*</ts> the <cx>janitor</cx> , with all <cx>his</cx> treasures piled *VBD* up in the basement , <c2>Jim</c2> <ts>would have *VB* pulled *VBN* out</ts> <c2>his</c2> watch <t>every time he passed *VBD*</t> , just to see *VB* <cx>him</cx> pluck *VB* at <cx>his</cx> beard from envy . 

So <ts>now</ts> <c1>Della ’ s</c1> *VBD* beautiful hair <ts>fell *VBD*</ts> about <c1>her</c1> rippling and shining *VBG* like a cascade of brown waters . It reached *VBD* below <c1>her</c1> knee and made *VBD* itself almost a garment for <c1>her</c1> . And <ts>then</ts> <c1>she</c1> did *VBD* it up again nervously and quickly . <t>Once</t> she faltered *VBD* <t>for a minute</t> and stood *VBD* still <t>>while</t> a tear or two splashed *VBN* on the worn red carpet . 

On went *VBD* <c1>her</c1> old brown jacket ; on went *VBD* <c1>her</c1> old brown hat . With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in <c1>her</c1> eyes , she fluttered *VBD* out the door and down the <p7>stairs</p7> <ps>to</ps> the <p8>street</p8> . 

<p9>Where</p9> <c1>she</c1> stopped *VBD* the sign read : “ <c6>Mme . Sofronie</c6> . Hair Goods of All Kinds. ” One flight up <c1>Della</c1> ran , and collected *VBD* herself , panting *VBG* . <c6>Madame</c6> , large , too white , chilly , hardly looked *VBD* the <c6>“ Sofronie. ”</c6> 

“ <ts>Will</ts> you <ts>buy</ts> *VBP* <c1>my</c1> hair ? ” <ts>asked *VBD*</ts> <c1>Della</c1> . 

“ <c6>I</c6> <ts>buy *VBP*</ts> hair , ” <ts>said</ts> *VBD* <c6>Madame</c6> . “ Take *VBP* <c1>yer</c1> hat off and let *VB* ’ s *VB* have *VBP* a sight at the looks of it. ” 

Down rippled *VBD* the brown cascade . 

“ Twenty dollars , ” said *VBD* <c6>Madame</c6> , lifting *VBG* the mass with a practised hand .

“ Give *VB* it to <c1>me</c1> quick , ” said *VBD* <c1>Della</c1> . 

Oh , and the <t>next two hours</t> tripped *VBN* by on rosy wings . Forget *VB* the hashed metaphor . <c1>She</c1> was *VBD* ransacking *VBG* the stores for <c2>Jim ’ s</c2> *VBD* present . 

<c1>She</c1> found *VBD* it <t>at last</t> . It surely <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* made *VBN*</ts> for <c2>Jim</c2> and no <cx>one</cx> else . There <ts>was *VBD*</ts> no other like it <ps>in</ps> any of the <p10>stores</p10> , and <c1>she</c1> <ts>had *VBD* turned *VBN*</ts> all of <p10>them</p10> inside out . It <ts>was *VBD*</ts> a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design , properly proclaiming *VBG* its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things <ts>should do *VB*</ts> . It <ts>was *VBD*</ts> even worthy of The Watch . <t>As soon as</t> <she>she</she> saw *VBD* it <c1>she</c1> knew *VBD* that it <ts>must be *VB*</ts> <c2>Jim ’ s</c2> . It was *VBD* like <c2>him</c2> . Quietness and value—the description applied *VBN* to <cg><c2><cx>both</cx></c2></cg> . Twenty-one dollars <cg>they</cg> took *VBD* from <c1>her</c1> for it , and <c1>she</c1> hurried *VBD* <p1>home</p1> with the 87 cents . With that chain on <c2>his</c2> watch <c2>Jim</c2> <ts>might be *VB*</ts> properly anxious about the time in <px>any company</px> . Grand as the watch <ts>was *VBD*</ts> , <c2>he</c2> sometimes looked *VBD* at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used *VBD* in place of a chain . 

When <c1>Della</c1> <ps>reached *VBD*</ps> <p1>home</p1> <c1>her</c1> intoxication gave *VBD* way a little to prudence *VB* and reason . <c1>She</c1> got *VBD* out her curling *VBG* irons and lighted *VBD* the gas and went *VBD* to work *VB* repairing *VBG* the ravages made *VBN* by generosity added *VBN* to love *VB* . Which is *VBZ* always a tremendous task , dear friends—a mammoth task . 

<t>Within forty minutes</t> <c1>her</c1> head was *VBD* covered *VBN* with tiny , close-lying curls that made *VBD* <c1>her</c1> look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy . <c1>She</c1> looked *VBD* <ps>at</ps> <c1>her</c1> <px>reflection in the mirror</px> long , carefully , and critically . 

“ *VB* If <c2>Jim</c2> <ts>doesn *VBP* ’ t kill *VB*</ts> <c1>me</c1> , ” *VBZ* <c1>she</c1> <ts>said *VBD*</ts> to <c1>herself</c1> *VB* , “ <ts>before</ts> <c2>he</c2> <ts>takes *VBZ*</ts> a second look at me , <c2>he</c2> ’ *VBZ* ll say *VBP* <c1>I</c1> look *VBP* like a <cx>Coney Island chorus girl</cx> . But what <ts>could</ts> <ch1>I</ch1> <ts>do—oh *VB*</ts> ! what could <c1>I</c1> do *VBP* with a dollar and eighty-seven cents ? ” 

<ts>At 7 o ’ clock</ts> the coffee <ts>was *VBD* made *VBN*</ts> and the frying-pan was *VBD* on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook *VB* the chops . 

<c2>Jim</c2> was *VBD* never late . <c1>Della</c1> doubled *VBD* the fob chain in her hand and sat <ps>on</ps> <p11>the corner of the table near the door</p11> that <c2>he</c2> always entered *VBD* . Then <c1>she</c1> heard *VBD* <c2>his</c2> step on the <px>stair away down on the first flight</px> , and <c1>she</c1> turned *VBD* white <t>for just a moment</t> . <c1>She</c1> had *VBD* a habit of saying *VBG* a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things , and now <c1>she</c1> whispered *VBD* : “ Please <c7>God</c7> , <ts>make *VBP*</ts> <c2>him</c2> think *VB* <c1>I</c1> am *VBP* still pretty. ” 

*VBP* The door <ts>opened</ts> *VBD* and <c2>Jim</c2> stepped *VBD* in and closed *VBD* it . <c2>He</c2> looked *VBD* thin and very serious . Poor fellow , <c2>he</c2> was *VBD* only twenty-two—and to be *VB* burdened *VBN* with a <cg><c1><c2>family</c2></c1></cg> ! <c2>He</c2> needed *VBD* a new overcoat and <c2>he</c2> was *VBD* without gloves . 

<c2>Jim</c2> stopped *VBD* inside the door , as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail . <c2>His</c2> eyes were *VBD* fixed *VBN* upon <c1>Della</c1> , and there was *VBD* an expression in them that <c1>she</c1> could not read *VB* , and it terrified *VBD* <c1>her</c1> . It was *VBD* not anger , nor surprise , nor disapproval , nor horror , nor any of the sentiments that <c1>she</c1> <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* prepared *VBN*</ts> for . <c2>He</c2> simply <ts>stared *VBD*</ts> at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on <c2>his</c2> face . 

<c1>Della</c1> wriggled *VBD* off the table and went *VBD* for <c2>him</c2> . 

“ *VB* <c2>Jim</c2> , darling , ” <c1>she</c1> cried *VBD* , “ <ts>don *VBZ* ’ t look</ts> at me that way . <c1>I</c1> <ts>had *VBD*</ts> <c1>my</c1> hair cut *VBD* off and sold *VBD* because <c1>I</c1> <ts>couldn *VBP* ’ t have *VBP* lived *VBN*</ts> <ts>through</ts> <t>Christmas</t> without giving *VBG* <c2>you</c2> a present . It ’ *VBD* <ts>ll grow out again</ts>—<c2>you</c2> won *VBD* ’ t mind , will you ? <c1>I</c1> just <ts>had *VBD* to do *VB*</ts> it . <c1>My</c1> hair <ts>grows *VBZ*</ts> awfully fast . Say ‘ Merry <t>Christmas</t> ! ’ <c2>Jim</c2> , and let *VB* ’ s *VB* be *VB* happy . <c2>You</c2> don *VBP* ’ t know *VBP* what a nice—what a beautiful , nice gift <c1>I</c1> ’ *VBP* ve got *VBD* for <c2>you</c2>. ” 

“ <c1>You</c1> ’ *VBP* <ts>ve cut *VBD* off</ts> <c1>your</c1> hair ? ” <ts>asked *VBD*</ts> <c2>Jim</c2> , laboriously , as if <c2>he</c2> <ts>had *VBD* not arrived *VBN*</ts> at that patent fact yet even <t>after the hardest mental labor</t> . 

“ Cut it off and sold *VBD* it , ” said *VBD* <c1>Della</c1> . “ <ts>Don ’ t</ts> <c2>you</c2> like <c1>me</c1> just as well , anyhow ? <c1>I</c1> ’ *VBP* m *VB* <c1>me</c1> without <c1>my</c1> hair , ain *VBP* ’ t <c1>I</c1> ? ” 

<c2>Jim</c2> looked *VBD* about the <p4>room</p4> curiously .

“ *VB* <c1>You</c1> <ts>say *VBP*</ts> <c1>your</c1> hair is *VBZ* gone *VBN* ? ” <c2>he</c2> <ts>said *VBD*</ts> , with an air almost of idiocy . 

“ <c2>You</c2> <ts>needn *VBP* ’ t look</ts> for it , ” <ts>said *VBD*</ts> <c1>Della</c1> . “ *VB* It ’ s *VBD* sold *VBN* , <c1>I</c1> <ts>tell</ts> *VBP* you—<ts>sold</ts> and gone *VBN* , too . It ’ *VBD* <ts>s</ts> <t>Christmas Eve</t> , <c2>boy</c2> . Be *VB* good to <c1>me</c1> , for it went *VBD* for <c2>you</c2> . Maybe the hairs of <c1>my</c1> head <ts>were *VBD* numbered *VBN*</ts> , ” *VBZ* <c1>she</c1> went *VBD* on with sudden serious sweetness , “ but nobody <ts>could ever count *VB*</ts> <c1>my</c1> love for <c2>you</c2> . Shall *VB* <c1>I</c1> <ts>put *VBD*</ts> the chops on , <c2>Jim</c2> ? ” 

*VBZ* Out of <c2>his</c2> trance <c2>Jim</c2> <ts>seemed *VBD*</ts> quickly to wake *VB* . <c2>He</c2> enfolded *VBD* <c2>his</c2> <c1>Della</c1> . <ts>For ten seconds let *VBP*</ts> <cg><c3><c8>us</c8></c3></cg> regard *VB* with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction . Eight dollars a <t>week</t> or a <t>million a year</t>—what is *VBZ* the difference ? A mathematician or a wit <ts>would give *VB*</ts> <c3>you</c3> the wrong answer . The <cg>magi</cg> <ts>brought *VBD*</ts> valuable gifts , but that was *VBD* not among <cg>them</cg> . This dark assertion <ts>will be *VB* illuminated *VBN*</ts> <t>later</t> on . 

<c2>Jim</c2> <ts>drew *VBD*</ts> a package from <c2>his</c2> overcoat pocket and threw *VBD* it upon the table . 

“ <ts>Don ’ t make *VBP*</ts> any mistake , <c1>Dell</c1> , ” <c2>he</c2> <ts>said *VBD*</ts> , “ about <c2>me</c2> . <c2>I</c2> <ts>don *VBP*</ts> ’ t think *VBP* there ’ s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that <ts>could make *VB*</ts> <c2>me</c2> like <c1>my girl</c1> any less . But if <c1>you</c1> ’ *VBP* ll <ts>unwrap</ts> that package <c1>you</c1> may see *VB* why <c1>you</c1> <ts>had *VBD*</ts> <c2>me</c2> going *VBG* a while <t>at first</t>. ” 

White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper . And <ts>then</ts> an ecstatic scream of joy ; and <ts>then</ts> , alas ! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails , necessitating *VBG* the immediate employment of all the comforting *VBG* powers of the <c2>lord of the flat</c2> . 

For there lay *VBP* The Combs—the set of combs , side and back , that <c1>Della</c1> <ts>had *VBD* worshipped *VBN* </ts> long in a <px> Broadway window</px> . Beautiful combs , pure tortoise shell , with jewelled rims—just *VBP* the shade to wear *VB* in the beautiful vanished *VBD* hair . They were *VBD* expensive combs , <c1>she</c1> knew *VBD* , and <c1>her</c1> heart had *VBD* simply craved *VBN* and yearned *VBN* over them without the least hope of possession . And <ts>now</ts> , they <ts>were *VBD*</ts> hers , but the tresses that <ts>should have *VB* adorned *VBN*</ts> the coveted adornments <ts>were *VBD* gone *VBN*</ts> . 

But <c1>she</c1> <ts>hugged *VBD*</ts> them to <c1>her</c1> bosom , and at length <c1>she</c1> was *VBD* able to look *VB* up with dim eyes and a smile and say *VB* : “ *VB* <c1>My</c1> hair <ts>grows *VBZ*</ts> so fast , <c2>Jim</c2> ! ” 

And <ts>then</ts> <c1>Della</c1> <ts>leaped *VBD* up</ts> like a little singed cat and cried *VBD* , “ Oh , oh ! ” 

*VB* <c2>Jim</c2> <ts>had *VBD* not yet seen *VBN*</ts> <c2>his</c2> beautiful present . <c1>She</c1> <ts>held *VBD*</ts> it out to <c2>him</c2> eagerly upon <c1>her</c1> open palm . The dull precious metal seemed *VBD* to flash *VB* with a reflection of <c1>her</c1> bright and ardent spirit . 

“ <ts>Isn ’ t *VBD*</ts> it a dandy , <c2>Jim</c2> ? <c1>I</c1> <ts>hunted *VBD*</ts> <px>all over town</px> to find *VB* it . <c2>You</c2> ’ *VBP* <ts>ll have *VBP* to look *VB*</ts> at the time a <t>hundred *VBN* times a day</t> <t>now</t> . Give *VB* <c1>me</c1> <c2>your</c2> watch . <c1>I</c1> <ts>want *VBP*</ts> to see *VB* how it looks *VBZ* on it. ” 

Instead of obeying *VBG* , <c2>Jim</c2> <ts>tumbled *VBD* down</ts> on the couch and put *VB* <c2>his</c2> hands under the back of <c2>his</c2> head and smiled *VBD* . 

“ <c1>Dell</c1> , ” <ts>said *VBD*</ts> <c2>he</c2> , “ *VBZ* <ts>let ’ s *VBZ* put *VB*</ts> <cg><c1><c2>our</c2></c1></cg> <t>Christmas</t> presents *VBZ* away and keep *VB* ’ em *VB* a <t>while</t> . They ’ *VBP* re *VB* too nice to use *VB* just at present . <c2>I</c2> <ts>sold *VBD*</ts> the watch to get *VB* the money to buy *VB* your combs . And <ts>now</ts> <ts>suppose *VBP*</ts> <c1>you</c1> put *VBP* the chops on. *VBP* ” 

The <cg>magi</cg> , as <c3>you</c3> know *VBP* , <ts>were *VBD*</ts> <cg>wise men</cg>—<cg>wonderfully wise *VBP* men</cg>—who brought *VBD* gifts to the <c7>Babe</c7> <ps>in</ps> the <p12>manger</p12> . <cg>They</cg> invented *VBD* the art of giving *VBG* <t>Christmas</t> presents . Being wise , <cg>their</cg> gifts were *VBD* no doubt wise ones , possibly bearing *VBG* the privilege of exchange in case of duplication . And here <c8>I</c8> <ts>have *VBP* lamely related *VBN*</ts> to <c3>you</c3> the uneventful chronicle of <cg><c1><c2>two foolish children</c2></c1></cg> <ps>in</ps> a <p1>flat</p1> who most unwisely sacrificed *VBN* for <cg><c1><c2>each other</c2></c1></cg> the greatest treasures of <cg><c1><c2>their</c2></c1></cg> <p1>house</p1> . But in a last word to the wise of <t>these days</t> let *VB* it be *VB* said *VBD* that of <cg>all who give *VBP* gifts</cg> <cg><c1><c2>these two</c2></c1></cg> <ts>were *VBD*</ts> the wisest . Of <cg>all who give *VBP* and receive *VBP* gifts</cg> , such as <cg><c1><c2>they</c2></c1></cg> <ts>are</ts> *VBP* wisest . <px>Everywhere</px> <cg><c1><c2>they</c2></c1></cg> are *VBP* wisest . <cg><c1><c2>They</c2></c1></cg> are *VBP* the <cg>magi</cg> .
