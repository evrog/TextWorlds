<title>THE GIFT OF THE MAGI</title>
<author>by O. Henry</author>

One dollar and eighty-seven cents . That was *VBD* all . And sixty cents of it was *VBD* in pennies . Pennies saved *VBD* one and two at a time by bulldozing *VBG* the <c1>grocer</c1> and the <c2>vegetable man</c2> and the <c3>butcher</c3> <t>until <c4>one ’ s</c4> cheeks burned *VBN* with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing *VBG* implied *VBN*</t> . Three times <c4>Della</c4> counted *VBD* it . One dollar and eighty-seven cents . And <ts>the next day</ts> <ts>would be *VB*</ts> Christmas . 

There <ts>was *VBD*</ts> clearly nothing to do *VB* but flop *VB* down on the shabby little couch and howl . So <c4>Della</c4> did *VBD* it . Which <ts>instigates *VBZ*</ts> the moral reflection that life is *VBZ* made *VBN* up of sobs , sniffles , and smiles , with sniffles predominating *VBG* . 

While the <c5>mistress</c5> of the <p1>home</p1> is *VBZ* gradually subsiding *VBG* from the first stage to the second , take *VB* a look at the <p1>home</p1> . A furnished <p1>flat</p1> at $ 8 per week . <p1>It</p1> <ts>did *VBD*</ts> not exactly beggar description , but <p1>it</p1> certainly had *VBD* that word on the lookout for the mendicancy <cg>squad</cg> . 

In the <p1>vestibule</p1> <ps>below</ps> was *VBD* a letter-box into which no letter would go *VB* , and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax *VB* a ring . Also appertaining *VBG* thereunto was *VBD* a card bearing *VBG* the name “ <c6>Mr . James Dillingham Young</c6>. ” *VBD* 

The “ Dillingham ” <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* flung *VBN*</ts> to the breeze <ts>during a former period of prosperity</ts> when <p1>its</p1> <c6>possessor</c6> was *VBD* being *VBG* paid *VBN* $ 30 per week . <ts>Now</ts> , when the income was *VBD* shrunk *VBN* to $ 20 , though , <cg>they</cg> were *VBD* thinking *VBG* seriously of contracting *VBG* to a modest and unassuming D. But <t>whenever</t> <c6>Mr. James Dillingham Young</c6> came *VBD* <p1>home</p1> and reached *VBD* <c6>his</c6> <p1>flat</p1> <p1>above</p1> <c6>he</c6> was *VBD* called *VBN* “ <c6>Jim</c6> ” and greatly hugged *VBN* by <c4>Mrs. James Dillingham Young</c4> , <t>already</t> introduced *VBN* to <c7>you</c7> as <c4>Della</c4> . Which <ts>is *VBZ*</ts> all very good . 

<c4>Della</c4> <ts>finished *VBD*</ts> <c4>her</c4> cry and attended *VBD* to <c4>her</c4> cheeks with the powder rag . <c4>She</c4> stood *VBD* by the <p1>window</p1> and looked *VBD* <ps>out</ps> dully at a gray <c8>cat</c8> walking *VBG* a gray <p2>fence</p2> in a gray <p2>backyard</p2> . <ts>Tomorrow</ts> <ts>would be *VB*</ts> <t>Christmas Day</t> , and <c4>she</c4> <ts>had *VBD*</ts> only $ 1.87 with which to buy *VB* <c6>Jim</c6> a present . <c4>She</c4> <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* saving *VBG*</ts> every penny <c4>she</c4> could <t>for months</t> , with this result . Twenty dollars a week <ts>doesn ’ t go *VBP*</ts> far . Expenses <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN*</ts> greater than <c4>she</c4> had *VBD* calculated *VBN* . They <t>always</t> <ts>are *VBP*</ts> . Only $ 1.87 to buy *VB* a present for <c6>Jim</c6> . <c4>Her</c4> <c6>Jim</c6> . <ts>Many a happy hour</ts> <c4>she</c4> <ts>had *VBD* spent *VBN*</ts> planning *VBG* for something nice for <c6>him</c6> . Something *VBG* fine and rare and sterling—something *VBG* just a little bit near to being *VBG* worthy of the honor of being *VBG* owned *VBN* by <c6>Jim</c6> . 

There <ts>was *VBD*</ts> <p1>a pier glass</p1> between the <p1>windows</p1> of the <p1>room</p1> . Perhaps <c7>you</c7> <ts>have *VBP* seen *VBN*</ts> <p1>a pier glass</p1> in an <p1>$ 8 flat</p1> . A very thin and very agile <c9>person</c9> <ts>may</ts> , by observing *VBG* <c9>his</c9> reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips , <ts>obtain *VB*</ts> a fairly accurate conception of <c9>his</c9> looks . <c4>Della</c4> , being *VBG* slender , <ts>had *VBD* mastered *VBN*</ts> the art . 

<ts>Suddenly</ts> <c4>she</c4> <ts>whirled *VBD*</ts> <ps>from</ps> the <p1>window</p1> and stood *VBD* <ps>before</ps> the <p1>glass</p1> . <c4>Her</c4> eyes were *VBD* shining *VBG* brilliantly , but <c4>her</c4> face <ts>had *VBD* lost *VBN*</ts> its color <ts>within twenty seconds</ts> . <t>Rapidly</t> <c4>she</c4> <ts>pulled *VBD*</ts> down <c4>her</c4> hair and let *VB* it fall *VB* to its full length . 

<t>Now</t> , there were *VBD* two possessions of the <cg><c4><c6>James Dillingham Youngs</c6></c4></cg> in which <cg><c4><c6>they</c6></c4></cg> <cg><c4><c6>both</c6></c4></cg> took *VBD* a mighty pride . One was *VBD* <c6>Jim ’ s</c6> *VBD* gold watch that <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN*</ts> <c6>his</c6> <c10>father ’ s</c10> and <c6>his</c6> <c11>grandfather ’ s</c11> . The other was *VBD* <c4>Della ’ s</c4> *VBD* hair . <ts>Had *VBD*</ts> the <c12>queen of Sheba</c12> <ts>lived *VBD*</ts> in the <p3>flat</p3> <ps>across</ps> the <p4>airshaft</p4> , <c4>Della</c4> <ts>would have *VB* let *VB*</ts> <c4>her</c4> hair *VB* hang out the <p1>window</p1> <ts>some day</ts> to dry *VB* just to depreciate *VB* <c12>Her Majesty ’</c12> s jewels and gifts . <ts>Had</ts> <c13>King Solomon</c13> <ts>been *VBN*</ts> the <c14>janitor</c14> , with all <c13>his</c13> treasures piled *VBD* up in the <p5>basement</p5> , <c6>Jim</c6> <ts>would have *VB* pulled *VBN*</ts> out <c6>his</c6> watch <ts>every time</ts> <c6>he</c6> <ts>passed *VBD*</ts> , just to see *VB* <c13>him</c13> pluck *VB* at <c13>his</c13> beard from envy . 

So <ts>now</ts> <c4>Della</c4> ’ s *VBD* beautiful hair fell *VBD* about <c4>her</c4> rippling and shining *VBG* like a cascade of brown waters . It reached *VBD* below <c4>her</c4> knee and made *VBD* itself almost a garment for <c4>her</c4> . And <ts>then</ts> <c4>she</c4> did *VBD* it up again nervously and quickly . <ts>Once</ts> <c4>she</c4> faltered *VBD* <t>for a minute</t> and stood *VBD* still while a tear or two splashed *VBN* on the worn red carpet . 

On went *VBD* <c4>her</c4> old brown jacket ; on went *VBD* <c4>her</c4> old brown hat . With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in <c4>her</c4> eyes , <c4>she</c4> fluttered *VBD* <ps>out</ps> the door and <ps>down</ps> the stairs <ps>to</ps> the <p6>street</p6> . 

<p7>Where</p7> <c4>she</c4> stopped *VBD* the sign read : “<c15>Mme . Sofronie</c15> . Hair Goods of All Kinds. ” <p7>One flight up</p7> <c4>Della</c4> ran , and collected *VBD* <c4>herself</c4> , panting *VBG* . <c15>Madame</c15> , large , too white , chilly , hardly looked *VBD* the “ Sofronie. ” 

“ <ts>Will</ts> <c15>you</c15> <ts>buy *VBP*</ts> <c4>my</c4> hair ? ” asked *VBD* <c4>Della</c4> . 

“ <c15>I</c15> <ts>buy *VBP*</ts> hair , ” <ts>said *VBD*</ts> <c15>Madame</c15> . “ <ts>Take *VBP*</ts> <c4>yer</c4> hat off and let *VB* ’ s *VB* have *VBP* a sight at the looks of it. ” 

Down <ts>rippled *VBD*</ts>  the brown cascade . 

“ Twenty dollars , ” said *VBD* <c15>Madame</c15> , lifting *VBG* the mass with a practised hand .

“ <ts>Give *VB*</ts> it to <c4>me</c4> quick , ” <ts>said *VBD*</ts> <c4>Della</c4> . 

Oh , and the <ts>next two hours</ts> tripped *VBN* by on rosy wings . <ts>Forget *VB*</ts> the hashed metaphor . <c4>She</c4> <ts>was *VBD* ransacking *VBG*</ts> the <p8>stores</p8> for <c6>Jim</c6> ’ s *VBD* present . 

<c4>She</c4> found *VBD* <c17>it</c17> <t>at last</t> . <c17>It</c17> surely <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* made *VBN*</ts> for <c6>Jim</c6> and <c16>no one</c16> else . There <ts>was *VBD*</ts> no other like <c17>it</c17> in any of the <p8>stores</p8> , and <c4>she</c4> <ts>had *VBD* turned *VBN*</ts> all of <p8>them</p8> inside out . <c17>It</c17> <ts>was *VBD*</ts> a platinum fob <c17>chain</c17> simple and chaste in design , properly proclaiming *VBG* <c17>its</c17> value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do *VB* . <c17>It</c17> was *VBD* even worthy of The Watch . <ts>As soon as</ts> <c4>she</c4> saw *VBD* <c17>it</c17> <c4>she</c4> knew *VBD* that <c17>it</c17> must be *VB* <c6>Jim</c6> ’ s . <c17>It</c17> was *VBD* like <c6>him</c6> . Quietness and value—the description applied *VBN* to <cg><c6><c17>both</c17></c6></cg> . Twenty-one dollars <c18>they</c18> took *VBD* from <c4>her</c4> for <c17>it</c17> , and <c4>she</c4> hurried *VBD* <p1>home</p1> with the 87 cents . With that <c17>chain</c17> on <c6>his</c6> watch <c6>Jim</c6> <ts>might be *VB*</ts> properly anxious about the time in any company . Grand as the watch <ts>was *VBD*</ts> , <c6>he</c6> <ts>sometimes</ts> looked *VBD* at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that <c6>he</c6> used *VBD* in place of a <c17>chain</c17> . 

<ts>When</ts> <c4>Della</c4> reached *VBD* <p1>home</p1> <c4>her</c4> intoxication gave *VBD* way a little to prudence *VB* and reason . <c4>She</c4> got *VBD* out <c4>her</c4> curling *VBG* irons and lighted *VBD* the gas and went *VBD* to work *VB* repairing *VBG* the ravages made *VBN* by generosity added *VBN* to love *VB* . Which <ts>is *VBZ*</ts> <t>always</t> a tremendous task , <c7>dear friends</c7>—a mammoth task . 

<ts>Within forty minutes</ts> <c4>her</c4> head <ts>was *VBD* covered *VBN*</ts> with tiny , close-lying curls that made *VBD* <c4>her</c4> look wonderfully like a truant <c19>schoolboy</c19> . <c4>She</c4> looked *VBD* at <c4>her</c4> reflection in the mirror long , carefully , and critically . 

“ *VB* If <c6>Jim</c6> <ts>doesn *VBP* ’ t kill *VB*</ts> <c4>me</c4> , ” *VBZ* <c4>she</c4> <ts>said *VBD*</ts> to <c4>herself</c4> *VB* , “ <ts>before</ts> <c6>he</c6> <ts>takes *VBZ*</ts> a second look at <c4>me</c4> , <c6>he</c6> ’<ts> *VBZ* ll say *VBP*</ts> <c4>I</c4> <ts>look *VBP*</ts> like a <c20>Coney Island chorus girl</c20> . But what <ts>could</ts> <c4>I</c4> <ts>do</ts> —oh *VB* ! what <ts>could</ts> <c4>I</c4> <ts>do</ts> *VBP* with a dollar and eighty-seven cents ? ” 

<ts>At 7 o ’ clock</ts> the coffee was *VBD* made *VBN* and the frying-pan was *VBD* on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook *VB* the chops .

 <c6>Jim</c6> was *VBD* <t>never</t> late . <c4>Della</c4> doubled *VBD* the fob <c17>chain</c17> in <c4>her</c4> hand and sat on the corner of the <p1>table</p1> near the <p1>door</p1> that <c6>he</c6> <t>always</t> entered *VBD* . <ts>Then</ts> <c4>she</c4> heard *VBD* <c6>his</c6> step on the <p1>stair</p1> away down on the first flight , and <c4>she</c4> turned *VBD* white <t>for just a moment</t> . <c4>She</c4> had *VBD* a habit of saying *VBG* a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things , and <t>now</t> <c4>she</c4> whispered *VBD* : “ Please <c21>God</c21> , <ts>make *VBP*</ts> <c6>him</c6> think *VB* <c4>I</c4> am *VBP* <ts>still</ts> pretty. ” 

*VBP* The <p1>door</p1> opened *VBD* and <c6>Jim</c6> stepped *VBD* in and closed *VBD* <p1>it</p1> . <c6>He</c6> looked *VBD* thin and very serious . Poor <c6>fellow</c6> , <c6>he</c6> was *VBD* only twenty-two—and to be *VB* burdened *VBN* with a family ! <c6>He</c6> needed *VBD* a new overcoat and <c6>he</c6> was *VBD* without gloves . 

<c6>Jim</c6> stopped *VBD* <p1>inside</p1> the <p1>door</p1> , as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail . <c6>His</c6> eyes were *VBD* fixed *VBN* upon <c4>Della</c4> , and there was *VBD* an expression in them that <c4>she</c4> could not read *VB* , and it terrified *VBD* <c4>her</c4> . It was *VBD* not anger , nor surprise , nor disapproval , nor horror , nor any of the sentiments that <c4>she</c4> <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* prepared *VBN*</ts> for . <c6>He</c6> simply <ts>stared *VBD*</ts> at <c4>her</c4> fixedly with that peculiar expression on <c6>his</c6> face . 

<c4>Della</c4> wriggled *VBD* off the table and went *VBD* for <c6>him</c6> . 

“ *VB* <c6>Jim</c6> , <c6>darling</c6> , ” <c4>she</c4> cried *VBD* , “ <ts>don *VBZ* ’ t look</ts> at <c4>me</c4> that way . <c4>I</c4> <ts>had *VBD*</ts> my hair <ts>cut *VBD*</ts> off and sold *VBD* because <c4>I</c4> couldn *VBP* ’ t have *VBP* lived *VBN* through <t>Christmas</t> without giving *VBG* <c6>you</c6> a present . It ’ <ts>*VBD* ll grow</ts> out again—<c6>you</c6> won *VBD* ’ t mind , will you ? <c4>I</c4> just <ts>had *VBD*</ts> to do *VB* it . <c4>My</c4> hair <ts>grows *VBZ*</ts> awfully fast . Say ‘ Merry Christmas ! ’ <c6>Jim</c6> , and let *VB* ’ s *VB* be *VB* happy . <c6>You</c6> don *VBP* ’ t know *VBP* what a nice—what a beautiful , nice gift <c4>I</c4> ’ *VBP* ve got *VBD* for <c6>you</c6> . ” 

“ <c4>You</c4> ’ <ts>*VBP* ve cut *VBD*</ts> off <c4>your</c4> hair ? ” <ts>asked *VBD*</ts> <c6>Jim</c6> , laboriously , as if <c6>he</c6> <ts>had *VBD* not arrived *VBN*</ts> at that patent fact yet <t>even after</t> the hardest mental labor . 

“ <ts>Cut</ts> it off and sold *VBD* it , ” said *VBD* <c4>Della</c4> . “ <ts>Don ’ t</ts> you <ts>like</ts> <c4>me</c4> just as well , anyhow ? <c4>I</c4> ’ *VBP* m *VB* <c4>me</c4> without <c4>my</c4> hair , ain *VBP* ’ t <c4>I</c4> ? ” 

<c6>Jim</c6> <ts>looked *VBD*</ts> about the <p1>room</p1> curiously . 

“ *VB* <c6>You</c6> <ts>say *VBP*</ts> <c4>your</c4> hair is *VBZ* gone *VBN* ? ” <c6>he</c6> <ts>said *VBD*</ts> , with an air almost of idiocy . 

“ <c6>You</c6> <ts>needn *VBP* ’ t look</ts> for it , ” <ts>said *VBD*</ts> <c4>Della</c4> . “ *VB* It ’ <ts>s *VBD* sold *VBN*</ts> , <c4>I</c4> tell *VBP* <c6>you</c6> —sold and gone *VBN* , too . It ’ *VBD* s <t>Christmas Eve</t> , <c6>boy</c6> . Be *VB* good to <c4>me</c4> , for it <ts>went *VBD*</ts> for <c6>you</c6> . Maybe the hairs of <c4>my</c4> head were *VBD* numbered *VBN* , ” *VBZ* <c4>she</c4> went *VBD* on with sudden serious sweetness , “ but <c16>nobody</c16> could ever count *VB* <c4>my</c4> love for <c6>you</c6> . <ts>Shall *VB*</ts> <c4>I</c4> <ts>put *VBD*</ts> the chops on , <c6>Jim</c6> ? ” 

*VBZ* Out of <c6>his</c6> trance <c6>Jim</c6> <ts>seemed *VBD*</ts> quickly to wake *VB* . <c6>He</c6> enfolded *VBD* <c6>his</c6> <c4>Della</c4> . <ts>For ten seconds</ts> <ts>let *VBP*</ts> <cg>us</cg> regard *VB* with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction . Eight dollars a week or a million a year—what is *VBZ* the difference ? A <c22>mathematician</c22> or a <c23>wit</c23> <ts>would give *VB*</ts> <c7>you</c7> the wrong answer . The <c24>magi</c24> <ts>brought *VBD*</ts> valuable gifts , but that was *VBD* not among them . This dark assertion <ts>will be *VB* illuminated *VBN*</ts> <ts>later</ts> on . 

<c6>Jim</c6> <ts>drew *VBD*</ts> a package from <c6>his</c6> overcoat pocket and threw *VBD* it upon the table . 

“ <ts>Don ’ t make *VBP*</ts> any mistake , <c4>Dell</c4> , ” <c6>he</c6> <ts>said *VBD*</ts> , “ about <c6>me</c6> . <c6>I</c6> <ts>don *VBP* ’ t think *VBP*</ts> there ’ s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make *VB* <c6>me</c6> like <c6>my</c6> <c4>girl</c4> any less . But if <c4>you</c4> ’ <ts>*VBP* ll unwrap</ts> that package <c4>you</c4> may see *VB* why <c4>you</c4> <ts>had *VBD*</ts> <c6>me</c6> going *VBG* <t>a while</t> <t>at first</t> . ” 

White fingers and nimble <ts>tore</ts> at the string and paper . And <ts>then</ts> an ecstatic scream of joy ; and then , alas ! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails , necessitating *VBG* the immediate employment of all the comforting *VBG* powers of the <c6>lord</c6> of the <p1>flat</p1> . 

For there lay *VBP* The Combs—the set of combs , side and back , that <c4>Della</c4> <ts>had *VBD* worshipped *VBN*</ts> <ts>long</ts> in a <p9>Broadway window</p9> . Beautiful combs , pure tortoise shell , with jewelled rims—just *VBP* the shade to wear *VB* in the beautiful vanished *VBD* hair . They <ts>were *VBD*</ts> expensive combs , <c4>she</c4> knew *VBD* , and <c4>her</c4> heart <ts>had *VBD*</ts> simply <ts>craved *VBN*</ts> and yearned *VBN* over them without the least hope of possession . And <ts>now</ts> , they were *VBD* <c4>hers</c4> , but the tresses that <ts>should have *VB* adorned *VBN*</ts> the coveted adornments <ts>were *VBD* gone *VBN*</ts> . 

But <c4>she</c4> hugged *VBD* them to <c4>her</c4> bosom , and at length <c4>she</c4> was *VBD* able to look *VB* up with dim eyes and a smile and say *VB* : “ *VB* <c4>My</c4> hair <ts>grows *VBZ*</ts> so fast , <c6>Jim</c6> ! ” 

And <ts>then</ts> <c4>Della</c4> <ts>leaped *VBD*</ts> up like a little singed cat and cried *VBD* , “ Oh , oh ! ” 

*VB* <c6>Jim</c6> <ts>had *VBD* not yet seen *VBN*</ts> <c6>his</c6> beautiful present . <c4>She</c4> <ts>held *VBD*</ts> <c17>it</c17> out to <c6>him</c6> eagerly upon <c4>her</c4> open palm . The dull precious metal seemed *VBD* to flash *VB* with a reflection of <c4>her</c4> bright and ardent spirit . 

“ <ts>Isn ’ t *VBD*</ts> <c17>it</c17> a dandy , <c6>Jim</c6> ? <c4>I</c4> <ts>hunted *VBD*</ts> all over <p10>town</p10> to find *VB* <c17>it</c17> . <c6>You</c6> ’ <ts>*VBP* ll have *VBP* to look *VB*</ts> at the time a hundred *VBN* times a day <ts>now</ts> . <ts>Give *VB*</ts> <c4>me</c4> <c6>your</c6> watch . <c4>I</c4> want *VBP* to see *VB* how it looks *VBZ* on <c17>it</c17> . ” 

Instead of obeying *VBG* , <c6>Jim</c6> <ts>tumbled *VBD*</ts> down on the <p1>couch</p1> and put *VB* <c6>his</c6> hands under the back of <c6>his</c6> head and smiled *VBD* . 

“ <c4>Dell</c4> , ” said *VBD* <c6>he</c6> , “ <ts>*VBZ* let ’ s *VBZ* put *VB*</ts> <cg><c4><c6>our</c6></c4></cg> Christmas presents *VBZ* away and keep *VB* ’ em *VB* <t>a while</t> . They ’ *VBP* re *VB* too nice to use *VB* just <t>at present</t> . <c6>I</c6> <ts>sold *VBD*</ts> the watch to get *VB* the money to buy *VB* <c4>your</c4> combs . And <ts>now</ts> <ts>suppose *VBP*</ts> <c4>you</c4> put *VBP* the chops on. *VBP* ” 

The <c24>magi</c24> , as <c7>you</c7> <ts>know *VBP*</ts> , <ts>were *VBD*</ts> wise <c24>men</c24> —wonderfully wise *VBP* <c24>men</c24> — <c24>who</c24> brought *VBD* gifts to the <c25>Babe</c25> in the <p11>manger</p11> . <c24>They</c24> invented *VBD* the art of giving *VBG* Christmas presents . Being wise , <c24>their</c24> gifts were *VBD* no doubt wise ones , possibly bearing *VBG* the privilege of exchange in case of duplication .
