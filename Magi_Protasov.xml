<title>THE GIFT OF THE MAGI</title>
<author>by O. Henry</author>

One dollar and eighty-seven cents . That <t>was *VBD*</t> all . And sixty cents of it was *VBD* in pennies . Pennies saved *VBD* one and two at a time by bulldozing *VBG* <c1>the grocer</c1> and <c2>the vegetable man</c2> and <c3>the butcher</c3> until <cx>one ’ s</cx> cheeks burned *VBN* with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing *VBG* implied *VBN* . <t>Three times</t> <c4>Della</c4> counted *VBD* it . One dollar and eighty-seven cents . And <t>the next day</t> <ts>would be *VB* Christmas</ts> . 

There was *VBD* clearly nothing to do *VB* but flop *VB* down <p1>on the shabby little couch</p1> and howl . So <c4>Della</c4> did *VBD* it . Which <ts>instigates *VBZ*</ts> the moral reflection that life is *VBZ* made *VBN* up of sobs , sniffles , and smiles , with sniffles predominating *VBG* . 

While <c4>the mistress of <p2>the home</p2></c4> <ts>is *VBZ* gradually subsiding *VBG*</ts> from the first stage to the second , take *VB* a look at <p2>the home</p2> . <p2>A furnished flat</p2> at $ 8 per week . It did *VBD* not exactly beggar description , but it certainly had *VBD* that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad . 

In <ps>the vestibule below</ps> was *VBD* a letter-box into which no letter <ts>would go *VB*</ts> , and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax *VB* a ring . Also appertaining *VBG* thereunto was *VBD* a card bearing *VBG* the name <c5>“ Mr . James Dillingham Young. ” </c5>*VBD* 

The <c5>“ Dillingham ”</c5> <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* flung *VBN*</ts> to the breeze during <t>a former period</t> of prosperity when <c5>its possessor</c5> was *VBD* being *VBG* paid *VBN* $ 30 per week . <ts>Now</ts> , when the income was *VBD* shrunk *VBN* to $ 20 , though , <cg>they</cg> were *VBD* thinking *VBG* seriously of contracting *VBG* to a modest and unassuming D. But <ts>whenever</ts> <c5>Mr. James Dillingham Young</c5> came *VBD* <p2>home</p2> and reached *VBD* <c5>his</c5> <p2>flat</p2> above <c5>he</c5> was *VBD* called *VBN* <c5>“ <c5>Jim</c5> ”</c5> and greatly hugged *VBN* by <c4>Mrs. James Dillingham Young</c4> , already introduced *VBN* to <cx>you</cx> as <c4>Della</c4> . Which <ts>is</ts> *VBZ* all very good . 

<c4>Della</c4> <ts>finished *VBD*</ts> <c4>her</c4> cry and attended *VBD* to <c4>her</c4> cheeks with the powder rag . <c4>She</c4> stood *VBD* <p4>by the window</p4> and looked *VBD* <ps>out</ps> dully at a gray cat walking *VBG* a gray fence <p6>in a gray backyard</p6> . <ts>Tomorrow would be *VB*</ts> <t>Christmas Day</t> , and <c4>she</c4> had *VBD* only $ 1.87 with which to buy *VB* <c5>Jim</c5> a present . <c4>She</c4> <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* saving *VBG*</ts> every penny <c4>she</c4> could <t>for months</t> , with this result . Twenty dollars a week <ts>doesn ’ t go *VBP*</ts> far . Expenses <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN*</ts> greater than <c4>she</c4> had *VBD* calculated *VBN* . They always <ts>are *VBP*</ts> . Only $ 1.87 to buy *VB* a present for <c5>Jim</c5> . <c4>Her</c4> <c5>Jim</c5> . Many a happy hour <c4>she</c4> had *VBD* spent *VBN* planning *VBG* for something nice for <c5>him</c5> . Something *VBG* fine and rare and sterling—something *VBG* just a little bit near to being *VBG* worthy of the honor of being *VBG* owned *VBN* by <c5>Jim</c5> . 

There was *VBD* a pier glass <p7>between the windows</p7> of the <p8>room</p8> . Perhaps <cx>you</cx> <ts>have *VBP* seen *VBN*</ts> a pier glass <p9>in an $ 8 flat</p9> . <cx>A very thin and very agile person</cx> may , by observing *VBG* <cx>his</cx> reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips , obtain *VB* a fairly accurate conception of <cx>his</cx> lxooks . <c4>Della</c4> , being *VBG* slender , <ts>had *VBD* mastered *VBN*</ts> the art . 

<ts>Suddenly</ts> <c4>she</c4> whirled *VBD* from <p4>the window</p4> and stood *VBD* <p10>before the glass</p10> . <c4>Her</c4> eyes were *VBD* shining *VBG* brilliantly , but <c4>her</c4> face had *VBD* lost *VBN* its color <t>within twenty seconds</t> . Rapidly <c4>she</c4> pulled *VBD* down <c4>her</c4> hair and let *VB* it fall *VB* to its full length . 

<ts>Now</ts> , there were *VBD* two possessions of <cg>the James Dillingham Youngs</cg> in which <cg>they</cg> both took *VBD* a mighty pride . One was *VBD* <c5>Jim</c5> ’ s *VBD* gold watch that <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN*</ts> <c5>his</c5> <c6>father</c6> ’ s and <c6>his</c6> <c7>grandfather</c7> ’ s . The other <ts>was</ts> *VBD* <c4>Della</c4> ’ s *VBD* hair . <ts>Had *VBD* <c8>the queen of Sheba</c8> lived *VBD*</ts> <px>in the flat across the airshaft</px> , <c4>Della</c4> <ts>would have *VB* let *VB*</ts> <c4>her</c4> hair *VB* hang <p4>out the window</p4> <t>some day</t> to dry *VB* just to depreciate *VB* <c8>her Majesty</c8> ’ s jewels and gifts . <ts>Had <c9>King Solomon</c9> been *VBN*</ts> the janitor , with all <c9>his</c9> treasures piled *VBD* up <px>in the basement</px> , <c5>Jim</c5> <ts>would have *VB* pulled *VBN*</ts> out <c5>his</c5> watch every time <c5>he</c5> passed *VBD* , just to see *VB* <c9>him</c9> pluck *VB* at <c9>his</c9> beard from envy . 

So <ts>now</ts> <c4>Della</c4> ’ s *VBD* beautiful hair fell *VBD* about <c4>her</c4> rippling and shining *VBG* like a cascade of brown waters . It reached *VBD* below <c4>her</c4> knee and made *VBD* itself almost a garment for <c4>her</c4> . And then <c4>she</c4> did *VBD* it up <t>again</t> nervously and quickly . <t>Once</t> <c4>she</c4> faltered *VBD* <t>for a minute</t> and stood *VBD* still while a tear or two splashed *VBN* on the worn red carpet . 

On went *VBD* <c4>her</c4> old brown jacket ; on went *VBD* <c4>her</c4> old brown hat . With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in <c4>her</c4> eyes , <c4>she</c4> fluttered *VBD* <ps>out</ps> <p11>the door</p11> and down <p12>the stairs</p12> to <p13>the street</p13> . 

<p14>Where <c4>she</c4> stopped *VBD* the sign read : “ <c10>Mme . Sofronie</c10> . Hair Goods of All Kinds. ”</p14> <px>One flight up</px> <c4>Della</c4> ran , and collected *VBD* <c4>herself</c4> , panting *VBG* . <c10>Madame</c10> , large , too white , chilly , hardly looked *VBD* the “ Sofronie. ” 

“ <ts>Will <c10>you</c10> buy *VBP*</ts> <c4>my</c4> hair ? ” <ts>asked *VBD*</ts> <c4>Della</c4> . 

“ <c10>I</c10> <ts>buy</ts> *VBP* hair , ” <ts>said</ts> *VBD* <c10>Madame</c10> . “ <ts>Take *VBP*</ts> <c4>yer</c4> hat off and let *VB* ’ s *VB* have *VBP* a sight at the looks of it. ” 

Down <ts>rippled *VBD*</ts> the brown cascade . 

“ Twenty dollars , ” said *VBD* <c10>Madame</c10> , lifting *VBG* the mass with a practised hand .

“ <ts>Give</ts> *VB* it to <c4>me</c4> <t>quick</t> , ” <ts>said</ts> *VBD* <c4>Della</c4> . 

Oh , and <t>the next two hours</t> tripped *VBN* by on rosy wings . <ts>Forget</ts> *VB* the hashed metaphor . <c4>She</c4> <ts>was *VBD*</ts> ransacking *VBG* <p15>the stores</p15> for <c5>Jim</c5> ’ s *VBD* present . 

<c4>She</c4> found *VBD* it <t>at last</t> . It surely had *VBD* been *VBN* made *VBN* for <c5>Jim</c5> and no one else . There was *VBD* no other like it <p15>in any of the stores</p15> , and <c4>she</c4> had *VBD* turned *VBN* <p15>all of them</p15> inside out . It was *VBD* a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design , properly proclaiming *VBG* its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things <ts>should do *VB*</ts> . It <ts>was *VBD*</ts> even worthy of The Watch . <t>As soon as <c4>she</c4> saw *VBD* it</t> <c4>she</c4> knew *VBD* that it must be *VB* <c5>Jim</c5> ’ s . It was *VBD* like <c5>him</c5> . Quietness and value—the description applied *VBN* to both . Twenty-one dollars they took *VBD* from <c4>her</c4> for it , and <c4>she</c4> hurried *VBD* <p2>home</p2> with the 87 cents . With that chain on <c5>his</c5> watch <c5>Jim</c5> <ts>might be *VB*</ts> properly anxious about the time in any company . Grand as the watch <ts>was *VBD*</ts> , <c5>he</c5> sometimes looked *VBD* at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that <c5>he</c5> used *VBD* in place of a chain . 

<t>When <c4>Della</c4> reached *VBD* <p2>home</p2></t> <c4>her</c4> intoxication gave *VBD* way a little to prudence *VB* and reason . <c4>She</c4> got *VBD* out <c4>her</c4> curling *VBG* irons and lighted *VBD* the gas and went *VBD* to work *VB* repairing *VBG* the ravages made *VBN* by generosity added *VBN* to love *VB* . Which <ts>is *VBZ*</ts> always a tremendous task , dear friends—a mammoth task . 

<ts>Within forty minutes</ts> <c4>her</c4> head was *VBD* covered *VBN* with tiny , close-lying curls that made *VBD* <c4>her</c4> look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy . <c4>She</c4> looked *VBD* at <c4>her</c4> reflection in the mirror <t>long</t> , carefully , and critically . 

“ *VB* If <c5>Jim</c5> <ts>doesn *VBP*</ts> ’ t kill *VB* <c4>me</c4> , ” *VBZ* <c4>she</c4> <ts>said</ts> *VBD* to <c4>herself</c4> *VB* , “ <ts>before <c5>he</c5> takes *VBZ* a second look at <c4>me</c4></ts> , <c5>he</c5> ’ *VBZ* ll say *VBP* <c4>I</c4> look *VBP* like <cx>a <px>Coney Island</px> chorus girl</cx> . But what <ts>could</ts> <c4>I</c4> do—oh *VB* ! what could <c4>I</c4> do *VBP* with a dollar and eighty-seven cents ? ” 

<ts>At 7 o ’ clock</ts> the coffee was *VBD* made *VBN* and the frying-pan was *VBD* on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook *VB* the chops . 

<c5>Jim</c5> was *VBD* never late . <c4>Della</c4> doubled *VBD* the fob chain in <c4>her</c4> hand and sat on the corner of the table <p11>near the door</p11> that <c5>he</c5> <ts>always</ts> entered *VBD* . <ts>Then</ts> <c4>she</c4> heard *VBD* <c5>his</c5> step <ps>on</ps> <p12>the stair away down on the first flight</p12> , and <c4>she</c4> turned *VBD* white for just a moment . <c4>She</c4> had *VBD* a habit of saying *VBG* a little silent prayer about the simplest everyday things , and <t>now</t> <c4>she</c4> whispered *VBD* : “ Please <c11>God</c11> , <ts>make *VBP*</ts> <c12>him</c12> think *VB* <c4>I</c4> am *VBP* still pretty. ” 

*VBP* The door <ts>opened *VBD*</ts> and <c5>Jim</c5> stepped *VBD* in and closed *VBD* it . <c5>He</c5> looked *VBD* thin and very serious . Poor fellow , <c5>he</c5> was *VBD* only twenty-two—and to be *VB* burdened *VBN* with <cg>a family</cg> ! <c5>He</c5> needed *VBD* a new overcoat and <c5>he</c5> was *VBD* without gloves . 

<c5>Jim</c5> stopped *VBD* <p16>inside the door</p16> , as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail . <c5>His</c5> eyes were *VBD* fixed *VBN* upon <c4>Della</c4> , and there was *VBD* an expression in them that <c4>she</c4> could not read *VB* , and it terrified *VBD* <c4>her</c4> . It was *VBD* not anger , nor surprise , nor disapproval , nor horror , nor any of the sentiments that <c4>she</c4> <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* prepared *VBN*</ts> for . <c5>He</c5> simply <ts>stared</ts> *VBD* at <c4>her</c4> fixedly with that peculiar expression on <c5>his</c5> face . 

<c4>Della</c4> wriggled *VBD* off the table and went *VBD* for <c5>him</c5> . 

“ *VB* <c5>Jim</c5> , darling , ” <c4>she</c4> cried *VBD* , “ <ts>don *VBZ* ’ t look</ts> at <c4>me</c4> that way . <c4>I</c4> <ts>had *VBD* <c4>my</c4> hair cut *VBD*</ts> off and sold *VBD* because <c4>I</c4> <ts>couldn *VBP* ’ t have *VBP* lived *VBN*</ts> <t>through Christmas</t> without giving *VBG* <c5>you</c5> a present . It <ts>’ *VBD* ll grow</ts> out again—<c5>you</c5> won *VBD* ’ t mind , will <c5>you</c5> ? <c4>I</c4> just <ts>had *VBD*</ts> to do *VB* it . <c4>My</c4> hair <ts>grows *VBZ*</ts> awfully fast . Say ‘ Merry <t>Christmas</t> ! ’ <c5>Jim</c5> , and let *VB* ’ s *VB* be *VB* happy . <c5>You</c5> don *VBP* ’ t know *VBP* what a nice—what a beautiful , nice gift <c4>I</c4> ’ *VBP* ve got *VBD* for <c5>you</c5>. ” 

“ <c4>You</c4> ’ <ts>*VBP* ve cut *VBD*</ts> off <c4>your</c4> hair ? ” <ts>asked *VBD*</ts> <c5>Jim</c5> , laboriously , as if <c5>he</c5> <ts>had *VBD* not arrived *VBN*</ts> at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor . 

“ <ts>Cut</ts> it off and sold *VBD* it , ” <ts>said *VBD*</ts> <c4>Della</c4> . “ <ts>Don ’ t</ts> <c5>you</c5> like <c4>me</c4> just as well , anyhow ? <c5>I</c5> ’ *VBP* m *VB* <c4>me</c4> without <c4>my</c4> hair , ain *VBP* ’ t <c4>I</c4> ? ” 

<c5>Jim</c5> <ts>looked *VBD*</ts> about <p8>the room</p8> curiously . 

“ *VB* <c4>You</c4> <ts>say *VBP*</ts> <c4>your</c4> hair is *VBZ* gone *VBN* ? ” <c5>he</c5> <ts>said *VBD*</ts> , with an air almost of idiocy . 

“ <c4>You</c4> <ts>needn *VBP*</ts> ’ t look for it , ” <ts>said *VBD*</ts> <c4>Della</c4> . “ *VB* It ’ <ts>s *VBD* sold *VBN*</ts> , <c4>I</c4> tell *VBP* <c5>you</c5>—sold and gone *VBN* , too . It ’ *VBD* s <t>Christmas Eve</t> , <c5>boy</c5> . Be *VB* good to <c4>me</c4> , for it <ts>went *VBD*</ts> for <c5>you</c5> . Maybe the hairs of <c4>my</c4> head were *VBD* numbered *VBN* , ” *VBZ* <c4>she</c4> went *VBD* on with sudden serious sweetness , “ but nobody <ts>could ever count *VB*</ts> <c4>my</c4> love for <c5>you</c5> . <ts>Shall *VB* <c4>I</c4> put *VBD*</ts> the chops on , <c5>Jim</c5> ? ” 

*VBZ* Out of <c5>his</c5> trance <c5>Jim</c5> <ts>seemed *VBD*</ts> <t>quickly</t> to wake *VB* . <c5>He</c5> enfolded *VBD* <c5>his</c5> <c4>Della</c4> . <t>For ten seconds</t> <ts>let *VBP*</ts> <cx>us</cx> regard *VB* with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction . Eight dollars <t>a week</t> or a million <t>a year</t>—what is *VBZ* the difference ? A mathematician or a wit <ts>would give *VB*</ts> <cx>you</cx> the wrong answer . <cg>The magi</cg> <ts>brought *VBD*</ts> valuable gifts , but that was *VBD* not among them . This dark assertion <ts>will be *VB*</ts> illuminated *VBN* <t>later on</t> . 

<c5>Jim</c5> <ts>drew *VBD*</ts> a package from <c5>his</c5> overcoat pocket and threw *VBD* it upon the table . 

“ <ts>Don ’ t make *VBP*</ts> any mistake , <c4>Dell</c4> , ” <c5>he</c5> <ts>said *VBD*</ts> , “ about <c5>me</c5> . <c5>I</c5> <ts>don *VBP*</ts> ’ t think *VBP* there ’ s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make *VB* <c5>me</c5> like <c4><c5>my</c5> girl</c4> any less . But if <c4>you</c4> <ts>’ *VBP* ll</ts> unwrap that package <c4>you</c4> may see *VB* why <c4>you</c4> <ts>had *VBD*</ts> <c5>me</c5> going *VBG* <t>a while</t> <t>at first</t> . ” 

White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper . And <t>then</t> an ecstatic scream of joy ; and <t>then</t> , alas ! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails , necessitating *VBG* the <t>immediate</t> employment of all the comforting *VBG* powers of the lord of the <p2>flat</p2> . 

For there lay *VBP* The Combs—the set of combs , side and back , that <c4>Della</c4> <ts>had *VBD* worshipped *VBN*</ts> <t>long</t> <ps>in a Broadway window</ps> . Beautiful combs , pure tortoise shell , with jewelled rims—just *VBP* the shade to wear *VB* in the beautiful vanished *VBD* hair . They <ts>were *VBD*</ts> expensive combs , <c4>she</c4> knew *VBD* , and <c4>her</c4> heart <ts>had *VBD* simply craved *VBN*</ts> and yearned *VBN* over them without the least hope of possession . And <ts>now</ts> , they <t>were *VBD*</t> <c4>hers</c4> , but the tresses that should have *VB* adorned *VBN* the coveted adornments were *VBD* gone *VBN* . 

But <c4>she</c4> hugged *VBD* them to <c4>her</c4> bosom , and at length <c4>she</c4> was *VBD* able to look *VB* up with dim eyes and a smile and say *VB* : “ *VB* <c4>My</c4> hair <ts>grows *VBZ*</ts> so fast , <c5>Jim</c5> ! ” 

And then <c4>Della</c4> <ts>leaped *VBD*</ts> up like a little singed cat and cried *VBD* , “ Oh , oh ! ” 

*VB* <c5>Jim</c5> <ts>had *VBD* not yet seen *VBN*</ts> <c5>his</c5> beautiful present . <c4>She</c4> <ts>held *VBD*</ts> it out to <c5>him</c5> eagerly upon <c4>her</c4> open palm . The dull precious metal seemed *VBD* to flash *VB* with a reflection of <c4>her</c4> bright and ardent spirit . 

“ <ts>Isn ’ t *VBD*</ts> it a dandy , <c5>Jim</c5> ? I <ts>hunted *VBD*</ts> all over town to find *VB* it . <c5>You</c5> <ts>’ *VBP*</ts> ll have *VBP* to look *VB* at the time a hundred *VBN* times a day <t>now</t> . <ts>Give *VB*</ts> <c4>me</c4> <c5>your</c5> watch . <c4>I</c4> want *VBP* to see *VB* how it looks *VBZ* on it. ” 

Instead of obeying *VBG* , <c5>Jim</c5> <ts>tumbled *VBD*</ts> down <p1>on the couch</p1> and put *VB* <c5>his</c5> hands under the back of <c5>his</c5> head and smiled *VBD* . 

“ <c4>Dell</c4> , ” said *VBD* <c5>he</c5> , “ *VBZ* <ts>let ’ s *VBZ*</ts> put *VB* <cg>our</cg> <t>Christmas</t> presents *VBZ* away and keep *VB* ’ em *VB* <t>a while</t> . They ’ *VBP* re *VB* too nice to use *VB* just <t>at present</t> . <c5>I</c5> <ts>sold *VBD*</ts> the watch to get *VB* the money to buy *VB* <c4>your</c4> combs . And <t>now</t> <ts>suppose *VBP*</ts> <c4>you</c4> put *VBP* the chops on. *VBP* ” 

<cg>The magi</cg> , as <cx>you</cx> know *VBP* , <ts>were *VBD*</ts> wise men—wonderfully wise *VBP* men—who brought *VBD* gifts to the <c12>Babe</c12> <p16>in the manger</p16> . <cg>They</cg> invented *VBD* the art of giving *VBG* <t>Christmas</t> presents . Being wise , <cg>their</cg> gifts were *VBD* no doubt wise ones , possibly bearing *VBG* the privilege of exchange in case of duplication . And here <cx>I</cx> <ts>have *VBP* lamely related *VBN*</ts> to <cx>you</cx> the uneventful chronicle of <cg>two foolish children</cg> in a <p2>flat</p2> who most unwisely <ts>sacrificed *VBN*</ts> for <cg>each other</cg> the greatest treasures of <cg>their</cg> house . But in a last word to <cg>the wise of <t>these days</t></cg> <ts>let *VB*</ts> it be *VB* said *VBD* that of all who give *VBP* gifts <cg>these two</cg> <ts>were *VBD*</ts> the wisest . Of all who <ts>give *VBP*</ts> and receive *VBP* gifts , such as <cg>they</cg> are *VBP* wisest . Everywhere <cg>they</cg> are *VBP* wisest . <cg>They</cg> are *VBP* <cg>the magi</cg> .
