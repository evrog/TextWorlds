SCHWEIK’S MISADVENTURES ON THE TRAIN 

There were three passengers <ps>in a second-class compartment</ps> of <ps>the Prague-Budejovice express</ps>.
Lieutenant Lukash, opposite whom an elderly and entirely bald gentleman was sitting, and Schweik, who was standing  modestly <ps>in the corridor</ps> and was just preparing to listen to a fresh storm of abuse from Lieutenant Lukash who,  regardless of the presence of the bald-headed civilian, kept yelling at Schweik <ms>throughout the journey</ms>, that he was a God-forsaken idiot and similar things.
The cause of the trouble was a trifling matter, a slight discrepancy in the number of pieces of luggage that Schweik was looking after. “One of our trunks has been stolen, you say,” <ts>snarled</ts>  the lieutenant at Schweik. “That’s a fine thing to tell anyone, you jackass. What was in that trunk?” 
“Nothing at all, sir,” <ts>replied</ts> Schweik, with his eyes  glued to the bald head of the civilian, who was sitting opposite to the lieutenant, and who appeared to be taking no interest whatever in the matter, but was reading the Neue Freie Presse. “All that was in that trunk was a looking-glass from the bedroom and an iron clothes hanger from the passage, so that we didn’t really lose anything, because the looking-glass and the hanger belonged to the landlord.” 
“Shut up, Schweik,” the lieutenant <ts>shouted</ts>. “I’ll  deal with you when we get to Budejovice. Do you know  I’m going to have you locked up?” 
“Beg to report, sir, I don’t,” <ts>said</ts> Schweik blandly. “You never mentioned anything to me about it before, sir.” 
The leutenant <ts>gritted</ts> his teeth, <ts>sighed</ts>, <ts>took</ts> a copy of the Bohemia from his pocket and <ts>began</ts> to read news about great victories, and the exploits of the German sub-marine “E” in the Mediterranean. <ts>Just when</ts> he <ts>had come</ts> to a report about a new German invention for blowing cities up by means of special triple detonating bombs dropped from aeroplanes, he <ts>was interrupted</ts> by  the voice of Schweik, who was addressing the bald-headed gentleman :
“Excuse me, guv’nor, but ain’t you Mr. Purkrdbek, agent of the Slavia Bank?” 
<ts>When</ts> the bald-headed gentleman made no reply, Schweik <ts>said</ts> to the lieutenant: “Beg to report, sir, I <ts>once</ts> read in the paper that the average man has 60,000 to 70,000 hairs on his head and that many examples show black hair is thinner as a rule.” 
And he <ts>continued</ts> remorselessly: 
“Then there was a doctor who said that loss of hair was due to mental disturbance during confinements.” 
But <ts>now</ts> a dreadful thing happened. The bald-headed gentleman <ts>jumped</ts> towards Schweik and <ts>shouted</ts> : 
“Get out of here, you dirty swine,” and having hustled him into <ps>the corridor</ps>, <ps>returned</ps> to the carnage, where he gave the lieutenant a little surprise by introducing himself. 
Evidently there had been a mistake. The bald-headed man was not Mr. Purkrdbek, agent of the Slavia Bank, but merely Major-General von Schwarzburg. The major-general was just proceeding in mufti on a series of garrison inspections and was <ts>now</ts> about to pay a surprise visit to Budejovice. 
He was the most fearsome major-general who had ever walked the earth, and if he found anything amiss, the 
following dialogue would ensue between him and the garrison commandant : 
“Have you got a revolver?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“All right, then. If I were in your place, I’d know what to do with it. This isn’t a garrison, it’s a pigsty.” 
And, as a matter of fact, there were always a certain 
number who shot themselves after one of his inspections, 
whereupon Major-General von Schwarzburg would always observe with satisfaction : 
“That’s the style! That’s what I call a soldier.” 
He <ts>now</ts> said to Lieutenant Lukash: 
“Where did you attend the cadet school?” 
“At Prague.” 
“So you attended a cadet school and are not aware that an officer is responsible for his subordinate? That’s 
a nice state of affairs. And then you carry on a conversation with your orderly as if he were a close friend of yours. You allow him to talk without being asked. That’s an even nicer state of affairs. In the third place, you allow him to insult your superior officers. And that 
caps all. What is your name?” 
“Lukash.” 
“And what regiment are you in?” 
“I was ” 
“I’m not asking where you were but where you are.” 
“In the 91st regiment, sir. They transferred me ” 
“ Oh, they transferred you, did they? Quite right, too. It won’t do you any harm to get to the front as soon as possible with the 91st regiment.” 
“That’s already settled, sir.” 
The major-general <ts>now</ts> held a lecture about how, <ts>of recent years</ts>, he had observed that officers talk to their subordinates in a familiar manner, and this he held to be a dangerous tendency, inasmuch as it promoted the spread of democratic principles. The private soldier must keep himself to himself, he must tremble before his superior officer, he must fear him. Officers must keep the rank-and-file at a distance of ten paces from them and not allow them to think independently or, indeed, to think at all. <ts>There was a time</ts> when officers put the fear of God into the rank-and-file, but <ts>nowadays</ts>
The major-general made a hopeless gesture with his hand. 
“<ts>Nowadays</ts> the majority of officers absolutely coddle the rank-and-file. That’s all I wanted to say.” 
The major-general picked up his newspaper again and engrossed himself in it. Lieutenant Lukash, as white as a sheet, went out <ps>into the corridor</ps> to settle accounts with Schweik. 
He found him <ps>by the window</ps>, looking as blissful and contented as a baby a month old who has drunk its fill and is now dropping off to sleep. 
The lieutenant <ts>stopped</ts>, beckoned to Schweik and pointed to an empty compartment. He <ps>entered</ps> at Schweik’s heels and closed the door. “Schweik,” he said solemnly, “<ts>the time has now come</ts>
for you to get the biggest hiffing on record. What on earth did you interfere with that bald-headed gentleman for? Do you know that he’s Major-General von Schwarzburg?” 
“Beg to report, sir,” <ts>announced</ts> Schweik, with the air of a martyr, “never in my life have   had the least intention of insulting anyone and it’s news to me about him being a major-general. As true as I stand here, he’s the living image of Mr. Purkrdbek, agent of the Slavia  Bank. He used to come to <px>our pub</px> and <t1>once</t1>, <ts>when</ts> he fell asleep at <px>a table</px>, some joker wrote on his head with a copying-ink pencil: ‘Please note our scheme for safeguarding your children’s future as per schedule IIIc enclosed.” 
<ts>After a short pause</ts>, Schweik continued : 
“There was no need for that gentleman to get into such a wax over a little mistake like that. It’s an absolute fact he’s supposed to have 60,000 to 70,000 hairs, like the average man has, just as the article said. It never struck me there was such a thing as a bald-headed major- general. Well, that’s what they call a tragic mistake, the same as anybody might make when he passes a remark and somebody else takes it in a wrong way without giving him a chance to explain. I used to know a tailor who ” 
Lieutenant Lukash <ts>gave</ts> one more look at Schweik and then <ps>left</ps> <ps>the compartment</ps>. He <ps>returned</ps> to his former seat, and <ts>after a few minutes</ts> Schweik’s guileless countenance <ps>appeared</ps> <ps>in the doorway</ps> : 
“Beg to report, sir, we’ll be <ps>at Tabor</ps> <ts>in five minutes</ts>. The train stops there for <ts>five minutes</ts>. Wouldn’t you care to order a little snack of something? <ts>Years and years ago</ts> they used to have very good ” 
The lieutenant <ps>jumped up</ps> furiously and <ps>in the corridor</ps> he said to Schweik: 
“ Let me tell you once more that the less I see of you, the better I shall like it. If I had my way I’d never set eyes on you again, and you can take it from me that I won’t if I can damn well help it. Don’t let me see anything of you. Keep out of my sight, you blithering jackass, you.” 
“Very good, sir.” 
Schweik saluted, turned smartly to the right-about, in the military manner, and then <ps>went</ps> <ps>to the end of the  corridor</ps>, where he <ps>sat down</ps> <ps>in a corner</ps> <ps>on the guard’s seat</ps> and entered into a conversation with a railwayman. 
“There’s a question I’d like to ask you, boss.” 
The railwaynnan, who evidently was in no mood for conversation, <ts>nodded</ts> listlessly, 
“I used to know a chap named Hofmann,” began Schweik, “and he always made out that these alarm signals never act, what I mean to say, that nothing would happen if you pulled this handle. To tell you the honest truth, I never gave the matter another thought, but as soon as I spotted this alarm outfit here, I thought I’d like to know what’s what, in case I should ever need it.” 
Schweik <ps>stood up</ps> and <ps>accompanied</ps> the railwayman <ps>to the alarm brake</ps> marked: “In case of danger.” The railwayman considered it his duty to explain to Schweik exactly what the alarm mechanism consisted of. 
“He was right <ts>when</ts> he said you’ve got to pull this here handle, but he was kidding you when he made out it don’t act. The tram always stops, because this is connected with all the carriages and the engine. The alarm brake is bound to act.” 
<ts>While</ts> he was saying this, they both had their hands on the handle of the lever and <ts>then</ts> — how it happened must remain a mystery — they <ts>pulled</ts> it and the train <ts>stopped</ts>. 
They were quite unable to agree as to who had actually done it and made the alarm signal work. 
Schweik <ts>declared</ts> that he couldn’t have done it. 
“It’s a fair marvel to me,” he said good-humouredly to the guard, “why the train stopped so sudden. It <ts>was going</ts>, then all <ts>at once</ts> it <ts>stopped</ts>. I’m more upset about it than what you are.” A solemn gentleman took the guard’s part and said he’d heard the soldier start a conversation about alarm signals. 
On the other hand, Schweik kept harping upon his good name and insisted that it was no advantage to him for the train to be late, because he was on his way to the front. 
“The station master’ll tell you all about it,” <ts>declared</ts> the guard. “This’ll cost you twenty crowns.” 
<ts>Meanwhile</ts> the passengers could be seen <ps>climbing down</ps> from <ps>the carriages</ps>, the head guard blew a whistle, and a lady in a panic started running with a portmanteau across <ps>the railway track</ps> into <ps>the fields</ps>. 
“ It’s well worth twenty crowns, that it is,” <ts>said</ts> Schweik stolidly, maintaining complete composure. “It’s cheap at the price.” 
<ts>Just then</ts> the head guard joined the audience. 
“Well, it’s about time we made a move,” said Schweik. 
“It’s a nuisance when a train’s late. If it was in peace time it wouldn’t matter so much, but now that there’s a war on, all the trains are carrying troops, major-generals, lieutenants, orderlies. It’s a risky business being late like that. Napoleon was five minutes late at Waterloo and, emperor or no emperor, he got himself into a mess just the same.” 
<ts>At this moment</ts> Lieutenant Lukash <ps>pushed</ps> his way through the group. He was ghastly pale and all he could utter was "the word “Schweik!” 
Schweik <ts>saluted</ts> and <ts>explained</ts> : 
“Beg to report, sir, they’re making out I stopped the train. The railway company have got very funny plugs on their emergency brakes. It’s better to keep away from them or else something’ll go wrong and they’ll ask you to fork out twenty crowns, the same as they’re asking me.” 
The head guard <ts>had already</ts> blown his whistle and the train <ts>was starting</ts> again. The passengers <ps>returned</ps> <ps>to their seats</ps>, and Lieutenant Lukash, without another word, also <ps>went back</ps> <ps>to his compartment</ps>. The guard now called upon Schweik to pay a fine of twenty crowns, as otherwise he would have to take him before the station master at Tabor. 
“That’s all right,” <ts>said</ts> Schweik.
“I like talking to educated people. It’ll be a fair treat for me to see that station master at Tabor.” 
<ts>When</ts> the train <ps>arrived</ps> <ps>at Tabor</ps>, Schweik with all due ceremony <ps>went</ps> to Lieutenant Lukash and said : 
“Beg to report, sir, I’m being taken before the station master.” 
Lieutenant Lukash did not reply. He had become completely indifferent to everything. It struck him that the best thing he could do was not to care a rap about anybody, whether it was Schweik or the bald-headed major-general, and to sit quietly where he was, to leave the train <ps>at Budejovice</ps>, to report himself at <ps>the barracks</ps> and to proceed to <ps>the front</ps> with a draft. <ps>At the front</ps>, if the worst came to the worst,  he would be killed and thus <ps>get away</ps> from this appalling world in which such monstrosities as Schweik were knocking about. 
<ts>When</ts> the train started again.  Lieutenant Lukash <ps>looked out</ps> <ps>of the window</ps> and saw Schweik standing <ps>on the platform</ps> and engrossed in a solemn colloquy with the station master. Schweik was surrounded by a crowd of people in which several railway uniforms were visible. 
Lieutenant Lukash heaved a sigh. It was not a sigh of pity. His heart felt lighter at the thought that Schweik 
had been left behind <ps>on the platform</ps>. Even the bald-headed major-general did not seem to be quite such a horrid bugbear. 
The train had <ts>long since</ts> puffed its way <ps>into Budejovice</ps>, but there was no diminution in the crowd round Schweik. 
Schweik was asserting his innocence, and had so convinced the assembly that one lady <ts>remarked</ts> : 
“They’re bullying another soldier again.” 
The assembly <ts>accepted</ts> this view, and a gentleman <ts>announced</ts> to the station master that he was prepared to pay Schweik’s fine for him. He was convinced that the soldier had not done what he was accused of. 
Then a police sergeant <ts>made</ts> his appearance and, having grabbed hold of a man in the crowd, <ts>led</ts> him away, saying: 
“What d’you mean by causing all this disturbance? If that’s the way you want soldiers treated, how d’you expect Austria to win the war?” 
<ts>Meanwhile</ts>, the worthy person who believed in Schweik’s innocence <ts>had paid</ts> the fine for him and <ps>had taken</ps> Schweik <ps>into the third-class refreshment room</ps>, 
where he had <ts>treated</ts> him to beer. And having ascertained that all his papers, including his railway warrant, were in the possession of Lieutenant Lukash, he generously <ts>presented</ts> him with the sum of five crowns for a ticket and sundry expenses. 
Schweik <ts>stayed</ts> where he was, and while he was quietly 
drinking his way through the five crowns, the people <ps>on the platform</ps> who had not witnessed Schweik’s interview with the station master, and had only seen a crowd in the distance, were telling each other that a spy had been caught taking photographs of <ps>the railway station</ps>, but a lady contradicted this rumour by declaring that it wasn’t a spy at all, but she had heard that a dragoon had struck an officer near <ps>the ladies’ lavatory</ps> because the officer was following his (the dragoon’s) sweetheart. These fantastic conjectures <ts>were brought</ts> to an end by the police, who <ps>cleared</ps> the platform. And Schweik <ts>went on</ts> quietly drinking ; he wondered with a tender concern what Lieutenant Lukash <ts>had done</ts> when he <ps>reached</ps> <ps>Budejovice</ps> and found no signs of his orderly anywhere. 
<ts>Before the departure</ts> of the slow train, <ps>the third-class refreshment-room</ps> became packed with travellers, consisting mostly of soldiers belonging to the most varied units and nationalities. The tide of war had swept them <ps>into hospital</ps> and now they were again <ps>leaving</ps> for <ps>the front</ps> to be wounded, mutilated and tortured once more, so as to qualify for a wooden cross on their graves. 
“Ihre Dokumente, vasi tokument," a sergeant-major of the military police <ts>now</ts> remarked to Schweik in German and broken Czech. He was accompanied by four soldiers with fixed bayonets.
“You sit, nicht fahren, sit, drink, keep on drink,” he <ts>continued</ts> in his elegant jargon. 
“Haven’t got none, milacku,” <ts>replied</ts> Schweik. 
“Lieutenant Lukash of the 91st regiment took them with him and left me here in the station.” 
“Was ist das Wort: milacek?" <ts>asked</ts> the sergeant-major, turning to one of his soldiers, an old defence corps man, who <ts>replied</ts>: 
“Milacek, das ist wie: Herr Feldwebel.” 
The sergeant-major <ts>continued</ts> his conversation with Schweik : 
“Papers, every soldier, without papers, lock up.” 
They <ps>took</ps> Schweik accordingly <ps>to the military transport headquarters</ps>. 
“It’s no use, chum, you’ve got to get it over. So in you go,” said the corporal to Schweik in a sympathetic tone. 
And he <ps>led</ps> Schweik <ps>into an office</ps> where, <ps>behind a table</ps> littered with papers, sat a small lieutenant who looked exceedingly fierce. <ts>When</ts> he saw Schweik with the corporal, he remarked: “Aha!” in a significant manner. 
Whereupon the corporal <ts>explained</ts> : 
“Beg to report, sir, this man was found in the station without any papers.” 
The lieutenant <ts>nodded</ts> as if to indicate that <ts>years and years ago</ts> he had guessed that precisely on that day and at that hour Schweik would be found in the station without papers, for anyone looking at Schweik <ts>at that moment</ts> could not help feeling convinced that it was quite impossible for a man of such appearance and bearing to have any papers on him. 
<ts>At last</ts> he asked; 
“What were you doing in the station?” 
“Beg to report, sir, I was waiting for the train to Budejovice, because I want to get to my regiment where I’m orderly to Lieutenant Lukash, but I got left behind 
on account of being <ps>taken</ps> to the station master to pay a fine through being suspected of stopping the express we were travelling in, by pulling the alarm signal.” 
“Here, I can’t make head or tail of this,” shouted the lieutenant. “Can’t you say what you’ve got to say in a straightforward manner, without drivelling away like a lunatic?” 
“Beg to report, sir, that <ts>from the very first minute</ts> I sat down with Lieutenant Lukash in that train that was to take us to our 91st imperial royal infantry regiment without any hanging about we had nothing but bad luck. <ts>First of all</ts> we lost a trunk, <ts>then</ts> by way of a change, there was major-general, a bald-headed cove” 
“Oh, good Lord!” <ts>sighed</ts> the lieutenant. 
And <ts>while</ts> the lieutenant fumed, Schweik <ts>continued</ts>: 
“Well, somehow or other this bald-headed majorgeneral got his knife into me <ts>at the very start</ts>, and Lieutenant Lukash, that’s the officer I’m orderly to, he <ps>sent me out</ps> 
<ps>into the corridor</ps>. <ts>Then</ts> in <ps>the corridor</ps> I got accused of doing what I’ve told you. And <ts>while</ts> they were looking into it, I got left behind <ps>on the platform</ps>. The train <ts>was gone</ts>, the lieutenant with his trunks and his papers and with my papers was gone too, and there I was left in the lurch like an orphan, with no papers and no nothing.” 
Schweik <ts>gazed</ts> at the lieutenant with such a touching air of gentleness that the latter was quite convinced of the absolute truth of what he was hearing from the lips of this fellow who, to all appearances, was a congenital idiot. He <ts>now</ts> enumerated to Schweik all the trains which had left for Budejovice <ts>since the departure</ts> of the express, and he <ts>asked</ts> him why he had missed them as well.
“Beg to report, sir,” <ts>replied</ts> Schweik, with a good-humoured smile, “that <ts>while</ts> I was waiting for the next train, I <ts>got</ts> into more trouble through having a few drinks.” 
“I’ve never seen such a fool,” pondered the lieutenant. 
“He owns up to everything. I’ve had plenty of them here, and they all swear blind they’ve never done anything. But this chap comes up as cool as a cucumber and says: I lost all the trains through having a few drinks.” 
The lieutenant decided that <ts>the time had now come</ts> to settle the matter once and for all. He therefore <ts>said</ts> in emphatic tones; 
“Now then, you blithering idiot, you fat-headed lout, 
go to the booking-offlce, buy a ticket and clear off to Budejovice. If I see any more of you, I’ll treat you as a deserter. Dismiss! ” 
As Schweik <ts>did not</ts> move, but kept his hand at the salute at the peak of his cap, the lieutenant <ts>bellowed</ts> : 
“Quick march outside, didn’t you hear what I said? 
Corporal Paldnek, take this drivelling idiot <ps>to the booking-office</ps> and buy him a ticket to Budejovice.” 
<ts>After a short interval</ts> Corporal Paldnek <ps>again</ps> <ps>appeared</ps> <ps>at the lieutenant’s office</ps>. Behind Paldnek, through <ps>the open door</ps>, peeped Schweik’s good-humoured countenance. 
“What is it now?” 
“Beg to report, sir,” whispered Corporal Palanek mysteriously, “he’s got no money for a ticket and I’ve got none, either. They won’t let him ride free because he’s got no papers to show he’s going to the regiment.” 
The lieutenant promptly <ts>delivered</ts> a judgment of Solomon to settle the quandary. 
“Then let him walk there,” he <ts>decided</ts>, “and when he 
gets there they can shove him in clink for being late. We can’t be bothered with him here.” 
“It’s no use, chum,” <ts>said</ts> Corporal Paldnek to Schweik when they were <ps>outside the office</ps> again, “you’ll have to walk to Budejovice, old sport. We’ve got some bread rations <ps>in the guard room</ps>. I’ll give you some to take with you.” 
And <ts>half an hour later</ts>, <ts>when</ts> they had treated Schweik to black coffee, and besides the bread rations had given him a packet of army tobacco to take with him to the regiment, he <ps>left</ps> <ps>Tabor</ps> at dead of night, singing an old army song. And heaven knows how it happened that the good soldier Schweik instead of turning southward 
towards Budejovice, <ps>went</ps> <ps>due west</ps>. He <ps>trudged through</ps> snow, wrapped up in his army greatcoat, like the last of Napoleon’s guards returning from the march on Moscow. 
When he <ts>got tired</ts> of singing, Schweik <ps>sat down</ps> <ps>on a pile of gravel</ps>, lit his pipe and <ts>after having a rest</ts>, <ps>trudged on</ps> towards new adventures.
