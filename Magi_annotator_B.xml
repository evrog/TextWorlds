<title>THE GIFT OF THE MAGI</title>
<author>by O. Henry</author>

One dollar and eighty-seven cents . That was *VBD* all . And sixty cents of it was *VBD* in pennies . Pennies saved *VBD* one and two at a <t>time</t> by bulldozing *VBG* the <c1>grocer</c1> and the <c2>vegetable man</c2> and the <c3>butcher</c3> until <c4>one ’ s</c4> cheeks burned *VBN* with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing *VBG* implied *VBN* . <t>Three times</t> <c5>Della</c5> counted *VBD* it . One dollar and eighty-seven cents . And <ts>the next day</ts> would be *VB* <t>Christmas</t> . 

There was *VBD* clearly nothing to do *VB* but flop *VB* down on the shabby little couch and howl . So <c5>Della</c5> did *VBD* it . Which instigates *VBZ* the moral reflection that life is *VBZ* made *VBN* up of sobs , sniffles , and smiles , with sniffles predominating *VBG* . 

<t>While</t> the <c6>mistress</c6> of the <p1>home</p1> is *VBZ* <ts>gradually subsiding *VBG*</ts> <ps>from</ps> the <p2>first stage</p2> <ps>to</ps> the <p3>second</p3> , take *VB* a look at the <p1>home</p1> . A <p4>furnished flat</p4> at $ 8 per week . It did *VBD* not exactly beggar description , but it certainly had *VBD* that word on the lookout for the <cg>mendicancy squad</cg> . 

In the <p5>vestibule below</p5> was *VBD* a letter-box <ps>into</ps> which no letter would go *VB* , and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax *VB* a ring . Also <ps>appertaining *VBG* thereunto</ps> was *VBD* a card bearing *VBG* the name “ <c7>Mr . James Dillingham Young</c7> . ” *VBD* 

The “ <c7>Dillingham</c7> ” <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN* flung *VBN*</ts> to the breeze <t>during a former period of prosperity</t> when its <c8>possessor</c8> was *VBD* being *VBG* paid *VBN* $ 30 per week . <t>Now</t> , <t>when</t> the income <ts>was *VBD* shrunk *VBN*</ts> to $ 20 , though , <cg>they</cg> were *VBD* thinking *VBG* seriously of contracting *VBG* to a modest and unassuming <c7>D</c7> . But <t>whenever</t> <c7>Mr. James Dillingham Young</c7> came *VBD* <p1>home</p1> and reached *VBD* <c7>his</c7> <p4>flat above</p4> <c7>he</c7> was *VBD* called *VBN* “ <c7>Jim</c7> ” and greatly hugged *VBN* by <c5>Mrs. James Dillingham Young</c5> , <t>already</t> introduced *VBN* to <c9>you</c9> as <c5>Della</c5> . Which is *VBZ* all very good . 

<c5>Della</c5> <ts>finished *VBD*</ts> <c5>her</c5> cry and attended *VBD* to <c5>her</c5> cheeks with the powder rag . <c5>She</c5> stood *VBD* by the window and looked *VBD* <p6>out</p6> dully <ps>at</ps> a <c10>gray cat</c10> walking *VBG* a gray fence <ps>in</ps> a <p7>gray backyard</p7> . <ts>Tomorrow</ts> would be *VB* <t>Christmas Day</t> , and <c5>she</c5> had *VBD* only $ 1.87 with which to buy *VB* <c7>Jim</c7> a present . <c5>She</c5> had *VBD* been *VBN* saving *VBG* every penny <c5>she</c5> could <ts>for months</ts> , with this result . Twenty dollars a <t>week</t> doesn ’ t go *VBP* far . Expenses <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN*</ts> greater than <c5>she</c5> <ts>had *VBD* calculated *VBN*</ts> . They always are *VBP* . Only $ 1.87 to buy *VB* a present for <c7>Jim</c7> . <c5>Her</c5> <c7>Jim</c7> . Many a happy <t>hour</t> <c5>she</c5> <ts>had *VBD* spent *VBN* planning *VBG*</ts> for something nice for <c7>him</c7> . Something *VBG* fine and rare and sterling—something *VBG* just a little bit near to being *VBG* worthy of the honor of being *VBG* owned *VBN* by <c7>Jim</c7> . 

There was *VBD* a pier glass <ps>between</ps> the windows of the <p8>room</p8> . Perhaps <c9>you</c9> have *VBP* seen *VBN* a pier glass in an <p9>$ 8 flat</p9> . A <c11>very thin and very agile person</c11> may , by observing *VBG* <c11>his</c11> reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips , obtain *VB* a fairly accurate conception of <c11>his</c11> looks . <c5>Della</c5> , being *VBG* slender , had *VBD* mastered *VBN* the art . 

<t>Suddenly</t> <c5>she</c5> <ps>whirled *VBD* from</ps> the window and <ps>stood *VBD* before</ps> the glass . <c5>Her</c5> eyes were *VBD* shining *VBG* brilliantly , but <c5>her</c5> face had *VBD* lost *VBN* its color within <t>twenty seconds</t> . <t>Rapidly</t> <c5>she</c5> pulled *VBD* down <c5>her</c5> hair and let *VB* it fall *VB* to its full length . 

<t>Now</t> , there were *VBD* two possessions of the <c7>James Dillingham Youngs</c7> in which <cg><c5><c7>they both</c7></c5></cg> took *VBD* a mighty pride . One was *VBD* <c7>Jim</c7> ’ s *VBD* gold watch that <ts>had *VBD* been *VBN*</ts> <c7>his</c7> <c12>father ’ s</c12> and <c7>his</c7> <c13>grandfather ’ s</c13> . The other was *VBD* <c5>Della</c5> ’ s *VBD* hair . <ts>Had *VBD*</ts> <cx>the queen of Sheba</cx> <ts>lived *VBD*</ts> in the <p10>flat across the airshaft</p10> , <c5>Della</c5> <ts>would have *VB*</ts> let *VB* <c5>her</c5> hair *VB* hang out the window some day to dry *VB* just to depreciate *VB* <cx>Her Majesty ’ s</cx> jewels and gifts . Had <c15>King Solomon</c15> been *VBN* the <cx>janitor</cx> , with all <cx>his</cx> treasures piled *VBD* up in the <px>basement</px> , <c7>Jim</c7> would have *VB* pulled *VBN* out <c7>his</c7> watch <t>every time</t> <c7>he</c7> passed *VBD* , just to see *VB* <cx>him</cx> pluck *VB* at <cx>his</cx> beard from envy . 

So now <c5>Della ’ s</c5> *VBD* beautiful hair fell *VBD* about <c5>her</c5> rippling and shining *VBG* like a cascade of brown waters . It reached *VBD* below <c5>her</c5> knee and made *VBD* itself almost a garment for <c5>her</c5> . And then <c5>she</c5> did *VBD* it up again nervously and quickly . <t>Once</t> <c5>she</c5> faltered *VBD* <t>for a minute</t> and stood *VBD* still while a tear or two splashed *VBN* on the worn red carpet . 

On went *VBD* <c5>her</c5> old brown jacket ; on went *VBD* <c5>her</c5> old brown hat . With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in <c5>her</c5> eyes , <c5>she</c5> <ts>fluttered *VBD* out</ts> the door and down the <p10>stairs</p10> to the <p11>street</p11> . 

Where <c5>she</c5> <ts>stopped *VBD*</ts> the sign read : “ Mme . Sofronie . Hair Goods of All Kinds. ” <p12>One flight up</p12> <c5>Della</c5> <ts>ran , and collected *VBD*</ts> <c5>herself</c5> , panting *VBG* . <c14>Madame</c14> , large , too white , chilly , hardly looked *VBD* the “ Sofronie. ” 

“ Will <c14>you</c14> buy *VBP* <c5>my</c5> hair ? ” asked *VBD* <c5> Della</c5> . 

“ <c14>I</c14> buy *VBP* hair , ” said *VBD* <ch14>Madame</ch14> . “ Take *VBP* yer hat off and let *VB* ’ s *VB* have *VBP* a sight at the looks of it. ” 

Down rippled *VBD* the brown cascade . 

“ Twenty dollars , ” said *VBD* <c14>Madame</c14> , lifting *VBG* the mass with a practised hand .

“ Give *VB* it to me quick , ” said *VBD* <c5>Della</c5> . 

Oh , and the <t>next two hours</t> <ts>tripped *VBN*</ts> by on rosy wings . Forget *VB* the hashed metaphor . <c5>She</c5> <ts>was *VBD* ransacking *VBG*</ts> the <p13>stores</p13> for <c7>Jim ’ s</c7> *VBD* present . 

<c5>She</c5> found *VBD* it at last . It surely had *VBD* been *VBN* made *VBN* for <c7>Jim</c7> and <cx>no one</cx> else . There was *VBD* no other like it in any of the <p13>stores</p13> , and <c5>she</c5> had *VBD* turned *VBN* all of them inside out . It was *VBD* a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design , properly proclaiming *VBG* its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do *VB* . It was *VBD* even worthy of The Watch . <t>As soon as</t> <c5>she</c5> saw *VBD* it <c5>she</c5> knew *VBD* that it must be *VB* <c7>Jim ’ s</c7> . It was *VBD* like <c7>him</c7> . Quietness and value—the description applied *VBN* to both . Twenty-one dollars they took *VBD* from <c5>her</c5> for it , and <c5>she</c5> <ts>hurried *VBD*</ts> <p1>home</p1> with the 87 cents . With that chain on <c7>his</c7> watch <c7>Jim</c7> might be *VB* properly anxious about the <t>time</t> in any company . Grand as the watch was *VBD* , <c7>he</c7> <t>sometimes</t> looked *VBD* at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that <c7>he</c7> used *VBD* in place of a chain . 

When <c5>Della</c5> <ts>reached *VBD*</ts> <p1>home</p1> <c5>her</c5> intoxication gave *VBD* way a little to prudence *VB* and reason . <c5>She</c5> got *VBD* out her curling *VBG* irons and lighted *VBD* the gas and <ts>went *VBD*</ts> to work *VB* repairing *VBG* the ravages made *VBN* by generosity added *VBN* to love *VB* . Which is *VBZ* always a tremendous task , dear friends—a mammoth task . 

Within <t>forty minutes</t> <c5>her</c5> head was *VBD* covered *VBN* with tiny , close-lying curls that made *VBD* <c5>her</c5> look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy . <c5>She</c5> looked *VBD* at <c5>her</c5> reflection in the mirror long , carefully , and critically . 

“ *VB* If <c7>Jim</c7> doesn *VBP* ’ t kill *VB* <c5>me</c5> , ” *VBZ* <c5>she</c5> said *VBD* to <c5>herself</c5> *VB* , “ <t>before</t> <c7>he</c7> takes *VBZ* a second look at <c5>me</c5> , <c7>he</c7> ’ *VBZ* ll say *VBP* <c5>I</c5> look *VBP* like a <cx>Coney Island chorus girl</cx> . But what could <c5>I</c5> do—oh *VB* ! what could <c5>I</c5> do *VBP* with a dollar and eighty-seven cents ? ” 

<t>At 7 o ’ clock</t> the coffee was *VBD* made *VBN* and the frying-pan was *VBD* on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook *VB* the chops . 

<c7>Jim</c7> was *VBD* never late . <c5>Della</c5> doubled *VBD* the fob chain in <c5>her</c5> hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that <c7>he</c7> always entered *VBD* . Then <c5>she</c5> heard *VBD* <c7>his</c7> step on <p10>the stair</p10> away down on <p14>the first flight</p14> , and <c5>she</c5> <ts>turned *VBD*</ts> white <t>for just a moment</t> . <c5>She</c5> had *VBD* a habit of saying *VBG* a little silent prayer about the simplest <t>everyday</t> things , and now <c5>she</c5> whispered *VBD* : “ Please <cx>God</cx> , make *VBP* <c7>him</c7> think *VB* <c5>I</c5> am *VBP* still pretty. ” 

*VBP* The door <ts>opened *VBD*</ts> and <c7>Jim</c7> <ts>stepped *VBD*</ts> in and closed *VBD* it . <c7>He</c7> looked *VBD* thin and very serious . Poor fellow , <c7>he</c7> was *VBD* only twenty-two—and to be *VB* burdened *VBN* with a family ! <c7>He</c7> needed *VBD* a new overcoat and <c7>he</c7> was *VBD* without gloves . 

<c7>Jim</c7> <ts>stopped *VBD*</ts> inside the door , as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail . <c7>His</c7> eyes were *VBD* fixed *VBN* upon <c5>Della</c5> , and there was *VBD* an expression in them that <c5>she</c5> could not read *VB* , and it terrified *VBD* <c5>her</c5> . It was *VBD* not anger , nor surprise , nor disapproval , nor horror , nor any of the sentiments that <c5>she</c5> had *VBD* been *VBN* prepared *VBN* for . <c7>He</c7> simply stared *VBD* at <c5>her</c5> fixedly with that peculiar expression on <c7>his</c7> face . 

<c5>Della</c5> <ts>wriggled *VBD* off</ts> the table and <ts>went *VBD*</ts> for <c7>him</c7> . 

“ *VB* <c7>Jim</c7> , darling , ” <c5>she</c5> cried *VBD* , “ don *VBZ* ’ t look at <c5>me</c5> that way . <c5>I</c5> had *VBD* <c5>my</c5> hair cut *VBD* off and sold *VBD* because <c5>I</c5> couldn *VBP* ’ t have *VBP* lived *VBN* through Christmas without giving *VBG* <c7>you</c7> a present . <ts>It ’ *VBD* ll grow out</ts> again—<c7>you</c7> won *VBD* ’ t mind , will <c7>you</c7> ? <c5>I</c5> just had *VBD* to do *VB* it . <c5>My</c5> hair grows *VBZ* awfully fast . Say ‘ Merry Christmas ! ’ <c7>Jim</c7> , and let *VB* ’ s *VB* be *VB* happy . <c7>You</c7> don *VBP* ’ t know *VBP* what a nice—what a beautiful , nice gift <c5>I</c5> ’ *VBP* ve got *VBD* for <c7>you</c7>. ” 

“ <c5>You</c5> ’ *VBP* ve cut *VBD* off <c5>your</c5> hair ? ” asked *VBD* <c7>Jim</c7> , laboriously , as if <c7>he</c7> had *VBD* not arrived *VBN* at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor . 

“ Cut it off and sold *VBD* it , ” said *VBD* <c5>Della</c5> . “ Don ’ t <c7>you</c7> like me just as well , anyhow ? <c5>I</c5> ’ *VBP* m *VB* <c5>me</c5> without <c5>my</c5> hair , ain *VBP* ’ t <c5>I</c5> ? ” 

<c7>Jim</c7> looked *VBD* about the room curiously . 

“ *VB* <c5>You</c5> say *VBP* <c5>your</c5> hair is *VBZ* gone *VBN* ? ” <c7>he</c7> said *VBD* , with an air almost of idiocy . 

“ <c7>You</c7> needn *VBP* ’ t look for it , ” said *VBD* <c5>Della</c5> . “ *VB* It ’ s *VBD* sold *VBN* , <c5>I</c5> tell *VBP* <c5>you</c5>—sold and gone *VBN* , too . It ’ *VBD* s Christmas Eve , <c7>boy</c7> . Be *VB* good to <c5>me</c5> , for it <ts>went *VBD*</ts> for <c7>you</c7> . Maybe the hairs of <c5>my</c5> head were *VBD* numbered *VBN* , ” *VBZ* <c5>she</c5> went *VBD* on with sudden serious sweetness , “ but <cx>nobody</cx> could ever count *VB* <c5>my</c5> love for <c7>you</c7> . Shall *VB* <c5>I</c5> put *VBD* the chops on , <c7>Jim</c7> ? ” 

*VBZ* Out of <c7>his</c7> trance <c7>Jim</c7> seemed *VBD* quickly to wake *VB* . <c7>He</c7> enfolded *VBD* <c7>his</c7> <c5>Della</c5> . <t>For ten seconds</t> let *VBP* us regard *VB* with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction . Eight dollars a week or a million a year—what is *VBZ* the difference ? A <cx>mathematician</cx> or a <cx>wit</cx> would give *VB* <c9>you</c9> the wrong answer . The <c15>magi</c15> <ts>brought *VBD*</ts> valuable gifts , but that was *VBD* not among them . This dark assertion will be *VB* illuminated *VBN* later on . 

<c7>Jim</c7> drew *VBD* a package from <c7>his</c7> overcoat pocket and threw *VBD* it upon the table . 

“ Don ’ t make *VBP* any mistake , <c5>Dell</c5> , ” <c7>he</c7> said *VBD* , “ about <c7>me</c7> . <c7>I</c7> don *VBP* ’ t think *VBP* there ’ s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make *VB* <c7>me</c7> like <c7>my</c7> girl any less . But if <c5>you</c5> ’ *VBP* ll unwrap that package <c5>you</c5> may see *VB* why <c5>you</c5> had *VBD* <c7>me</c7> going *VBG* a while at first. ” 

White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper . And then an ecstatic scream of joy ; and then , alas ! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails , necessitating *VBG* the immediate employment of all the comforting *VBG* powers of the <cx>lord</cx> of the <p4>flat</p4> . 

For there lay *VBP* The Combs—the set of combs , side and back , that <c5>Della</c5> had *VBD* worshipped *VBN* long in a <p15>Broadway window</p15> . Beautiful combs , pure tortoise shell , with jewelled rims—just *VBP* the shade to wear *VB* in the beautiful vanished *VBD* hair . They were *VBD* expensive combs , <c5>she</c5> knew *VBD* , and <c5>her</c5> heart had *VBD* simply craved *VBN* and yearned *VBN* over them without the least hope of possession . And now , they were *VBD* <c5>hers</c5> , but the tresses that should have *VB* adorned *VBN* the coveted adornments <ts>were *VBD* gone *VBN*</ts> . 

But <c5>she</c5> hugged *VBD* them to <c5>her</c5> bosom , and at length <c5>she</c5> was *VBD* able to look *VB* up with dim eyes and a smile and say *VB* : “ *VB* <c5>My</c5> hair grows *VBZ* so fast , <c7>Jim</c7> ! ” 

And then <c5>Della</c5> leaped *VBD* up like a little singed cat and cried *VBD* , “ Oh , oh ! ” 

*VB* <c7>Jim</c7> had *VBD* not yet seen *VBN* <c7>his</c7> beautiful present . <c5>She</c5> held *VBD* it out to <c7>him</c7> eagerly upon <c5>her</c5> open palm . The dull precious metal seemed *VBD* to flash *VB* with a reflection of <c5>her</c5> bright and ardent spirit . 

“ Isn ’ t *VBD* it a dandy , <c7>Jim</c7> ? <c5>I</c5> hunted *VBD* all over town to find *VB* it . <c7>You</c7> ’ <ts>*VBP* ll have *VBP*</ts> to look *VB* at the <t>time</t> a <t>hundred *VBN* times</t> a <t>day</t> <t>now</t> . Give *VB* <c5>me</c5> <c7>your</c7> watch . <c5>I</c5> want *VBP* to see *VB* how it looks *VBZ* on it. ” 

Instead of obeying *VBG* , <c7>Jim</c7> <ts>tumbled *VBD* down</ts> on the couch and put *VB* <c7>his</c7> hands under the back of <c7>his</c7> head and smiled *VBD* . 

“ <c5>Dell</c5> , ” said *VBD* <c7>he</c7> , “ *VBZ* let ’ s *VBZ* put *VB* <cg><c5><c7>our</c7></c5></cg> Christmas presents *VBZ* away and keep *VB* ’ em *VB* a while . They ’ *VBP* re *VB* too nice to use *VB* just at <t>present</t> . <c7>I</c7> sold *VBD* the watch to get *VB* the money to buy *VB* <c5>your</c5> combs . And <t>now</t> suppose *VBP* <c5>you</c5> put *VBP* the chops on. *VBP* ” 

The <c15>magi</c15> , as <c5>you</c5> know *VBP* , <ts>were *VBD*</ts> wise <c15>men</c15>—wonderfully wise *VBP* <c15>men</c15>—<c15>who</c15> brought *VBD* gifts to the <cx>Babe</cx> in the manger . <c15>They</c15> invented *VBD* the art of giving *VBG* Christmas presents . Being wise , <c15>their</c15> gifts were *VBD* no doubt wise ones , possibly bearing *VBG* the privilege of exchange in case of duplication . And here <c16>I</c16> have *VBP* lamely related *VBN* to <c9>you</c9> the uneventful chronicle of <cg><c5><c7>two foolish children</c7></c5></cg> in a <p4>flat</p4> <cg><c5><c7>who</c7></c5></cg> most unwisely sacrificed *VBN* for <cg><c5><c7>each other</c7></c5></cg> the greatest treasures of <cg><c5><c7>their</c7></c5></cg> <p1>house</p1> . But in a last word to the wise of <t>these days</t> let *VB* it be *VB* said *VBD* that of <cx>all</cx> <cx>who</cx> give *VBP* gifts <cg><c5><c7>these two</c7></c5></cg> were *VBD* the wisest . Of <cg>all</cg> <cg>who</cg> give *VBP* and receive *VBP* gifts , such as <cg><c5><c7>they</c7></c5></cg> are *VBP* wisest . Everywhere <cg>they</cg> are *VBP* wisest . <cg>They</cg> are *VBP* the <c15>magi</c15> .
